Ч 2. Вместо Квентина - хозяин хаты.
Квентин подходит к озеру, оттуда высовывается голова Дьяволицы и шипит на него. Квентин в страхе убегает.
Квентин встречает змею на вокзале и общается с ней.

Хелен чувствует у себя желание пожить в одной из хат на берегу океана. Как раз, испуганный Джо оттуда уезжает, и Хелен
поселяется в его хате. Однажды она приходит поздно, видит в темноте горящие глаза и слышит чей-то голос. Оказывается, это
пальмовый змей.
Хелен общается с Тимом, который рассказывает ей про давнюю хозяйку Рэнди. Хелен начинает переписку с Рэнди о страшных
явлениях, таких, как Пальмовый змей.
Потом Хелен видит, как Пальмовый змей целуется со змеей, в которую он влюблен.

They passed further and not far from a wall located in front of them they saw something. It was so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">astounding</span> and unexpectable that these people thought they gone mad. It was located under a big area of ice on the floor. This was an unclad female body visible through the surface of the area. It was laying on back and people saw anything what was in front of the body.

It was something really <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">percussive</span> and literally shocking. People liked this body very much.

But her shoulders, bust, waist, a part of body with genitals on it and legs - anything of this combined well. Ends of her arms were somewhere between hips and knees.

The criminal stopped shooting when he had caught the moment when there was not so much ice and thebullets had not touch the body. People noticed that ice had begun melding by itself. At least it had melded. And surface of the body was naked. The criminals go closer to the hole where the ice had melded. They wait while the eyes would be opened for a little time. When it had happened people saw big scary red eyes and listened load hiss. They were pretty scared. They <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">teetered</span> acutely. They have never seen something more thrilling in whole their life. One of them picked up his weapon and shooted, but at the moment when the bullet got to water,  the body had plunged under water very acutely so that people did not see it. And very soon a big and thrilling creature flied from water. It flied into legs of one of the criminals. The criminal fell, hit about the floor and cried from pain from serious scratches giving him by this brute. Also he suffered from pain from hitting about the floor. The brute turned around and jumped onto another one of the criminals, glaring with its clutches right to his face. The criminal fell on the floor. The other 3 criminals aimed their weapons on the brute and shot. But by the moment when bullets flew the brute had been jumped highly. The bullets hit in laying criminal. Next moment the brute landed on his body and turned around. The criminals released the bullets again and the brute jumped higly again so that the bullets flew under it. The brure landed and flew on the criminals, glaring its clutches into faces of 2 of them. It threw them on the floor. Its paw with clutches were poked into face of 1 of them and the second paw with clutches was poked in face of the second. The brute jumped off from these 2 criminals very quickly and jumped on the third criminal who was laying beside thoose 2. It glared in his face with its clutches. Then the brute felt air <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">jarring</span> behind it and jumped in water. The <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">jarring</span> was from shot of the 5th criminal and the animal was so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">artful</span> that bullet did not catch in it. The bullet flew under the brute at the moment when it was in its jump. In a few moments the brute jumped from water again and flew on 2 rest people. It made it very quickly and shrewdly so the criminals did not react to its new appearing with shoting. The brute <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">bumped</span> into their faces with its big and sharp clutches and threw these people on the floor. Faces of all the criminals were bleeded from very deep scratches. Poor criminals cried very loadly from hard pain which was taken them by clutches of the brute. They have already lost their forces to fight. At this moment the brute scratched them more in different places on their bodies. The criminals felt themselves worse from this pain additional. They cried very load from this terrible pain. The brute was scratching them not very long. It went from them soon, but their blood was spreading more and more. After the brute had left these people they were dead. The brute was transformed into a woman before exiting from the temple. The woman was going straight from the building and there was a moment when there was another one criminal behind her.  He was staying not far from the temple and noticed her when she was going beside him. He found this unbelievable <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">tempting</span> sight: a naked woman with tail similar to lion tail and horns similar to devil's horns was going by him.

He released bullet from its weapon. The woman felt air <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">teetering</span> under her back and very acutely fell on the floor. The bullet flew over her.

They cried very load from this terrible pain. The brute was scratching them not very long. It went from them soon, but their blood was spreading more and more. After the brute had left these people they were dead. The brute was transformed into a woman before exiting from the temple.
