I am such being whose mission is to save nature from the global pollution. According to the assignment beings of our species wipe nature litter such as carrion out.

I have already said you that it is a species of decomposers. It appeared when it had became a necessaty in the world. It differs from all the other species in our world. It is a special kind of decomposers. It is a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">grander</span> secret of nature. These creatures do not reproduce unlike all the other live species. There is no such fact that their dissapearing doubtlessly will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">turn out</span> a disastrous. It would can happen if they dissapeared at the moment. They exist when there is a necessaty in their existence and do not exist when there is no necessaty. They do not have to reproduce.

They exist at such moments when there is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">wholesale</span> pollution in nature. It <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">implies</span> such pollution level in nature when all the existing decomposers are not enough to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">cope with</span> such quantity of <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">litter</span>. These creatures are additional decomposers and their function is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">refinement</span> the <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">contaminated</span> plots of nature from the excess of carrion. The carrion is their main <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">livelihoods</span>. They are extra-decomposers, unbelieveable specific live species."]},

She is for performing functions of a nature <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">janitor</span>. She was interested to see live in an aquarium because she has human mind but she did not presume it would be forever. So the aquarium is only temporary <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">haven</span> for her. You can let go her from your aquarium in any moment and live in the swamp."]},

I <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">warrant</span> you there is no <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">threat</span> for you and your pets from Beatriz. She may be dangerous for predatory animals. She can poison space with a predator around her and kill the predator. Beatriz has bright color of wigs and it is the sign that she is poisonous. Many of predatory animals understand it and they will not <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">assault</span> her. This species is not for becoming victims for predators. So they have natural abilities to protect themselves from them. Besides nature has coined it in such way that predators do not have to became victims too. There must not be carrion clogging <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">exacerbation</span> in nature what is value of existence of these extra-decomposers. So predators must not die from extra-decomposers and extra-decomposers must live while they are performing their destination. Nothing must interrupt their existence earlier its time. We worried as if Junior had its eye on Beatriz as on a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">booty</span>. When we talked about this problem I did not remember the fact that Beatriz is poisonous. So we worried about Beatriz's live it not to be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">threatened</span> in connection with Junior. I do not know about dogs like your Junior if they <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">internalize</span> bright colors as a poison sign or they do not. If they do not than we have to worry about Junior's life more than about Beatriz's life.

In essence they are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hatched</span> in the world for this purpose and with no other one. In reality Beatriz is not a mermaid. Maybe you have already understood it, maybe not.  At leastways she is not a mermaid like all the mermaids about which we could listen in fairy-tales. She is a particular scavenger. The species Beatriz belongs to is called extra-decomposers but wherein Beatriz is a specific representative of this species. She has some essential differences from other representatives of this species. When they do what they are doing they will disappear from the world."},
      {"Judy": "Do you <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">imply</span> their existence is not <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">perpetual</span>?"},
      {"Helen": "Yes, of course."},

      {"Helen": "Of course, it is as I said. They are called extra-decomposers and have mission of nature <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">janitors</span>. This mission is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">refinement</span> nature from a global carrion pollution."},
      {"Cassandra": "Does Beatriz presume to have a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">perpetual abode</span> or she presumes to live everywhere if there is carrion?"},
      {"Helen": "I do not know exactly but I think she pretends to live in some other different places. I see she has interest to see the world in many different places. I think she will not want to live in some other aquarium of some other people because it is too tight for her. It is a disadvantage of life in my aquarium <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">albeit</span> I think it is enough <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">cumbersome</span> for such quantity of inhabitants of such size."},
      {"Cassandra": "When extra-decomposers disappear will it be a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">demise</span> from <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">famine</span>?"},
      {"Helen": "Oh, I have just found that I have never touched on this question in the conversation with Christian. Nobody of my acquainted can know it better than he does. But I have understood that extra-decomposers are going to be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">superfluous</span> part of anything alive in our planet when they complete their mission."},
      {"Cassandra": "How long will they exist?"},
      {"Helen": "Alas, I do not know that, too. "},
      {"Cassandra": "I found it is a pity that Beatriz has to leave you and, perhaps, live not so long as we. She is such a sweety!"},
      {"Judy": "But I hope the holidays will be very <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">invigorating</span>. It is so unusual and intriguingly! Le’s plan our holidays!"},
      {"Cassandra": "Oh, yes. I am <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">fully-baked</span>. it is so wonderful that holidays are coming!"},
      {"Judy": "I am <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">fully-baked</span>, too."},
      {"Helen": "Yes, of course we must do it. Judy, I understand you are tired with your studying and I presume you are tired, too, Cassandra. I presume the holidays will take place on a sun beach. We will go to a resort city and rent housing near a beach."},
      {"Cassandra": "It is wonderful! I have so great <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">inclination</span> to go to beaches at summer time!"},
      {"Helen": "I would like us to go to Miami. Besides the beach there is an engrossing water museum in this city. I am going to tell you about a marine game. The game is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">carried out</span> in huge aquariums in the museums of Miami. There are many different games which are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">carried out</span> in the <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immense</span> aquariums. The players are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">entitled</span> to put on diving suits and get into the aquariums where they take part of the game. Every player takes a basket before game starting. When I read about them in magazines, I had such impression that they are akin some sport games. I read about not to say <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immense plethora</span> of games but I am very interested of them and I think you will like it, too. I can tell you about some of those games in particular. Many of them have similarities. It is that they are based on quick movement in the water. The principle is following. We <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">plunge</span> into water and sit on the backs of dolphins and merpeople and wear to them with <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">cohesive</span> chains. There will be some bright objects quickly moving in different directions in the water discarded by a game leader. We <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">purport</span> to catch the objects earlier than our foes. So our marine inhabitants will serve us as a vehicles. They will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sweep</span> in the water and their purpose is to obtain such <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">vantage point</span> where we can reach out our hand and touch the object. We will have to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">strive</span> reach the object and touch it according to our purpose and put it in the basket. So we <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">purport</span> to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">muster</span> as many objects as we can. There will be some <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hurdles</span> for the movement to be easy in hurry. There will be such <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hurdles</span> as some objects we will must <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sweep</span> past and not offend. The objects will be such as <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">dustbins</span> and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">rattlesnakes</span>, but they will be not natural. They are only called so. They are such objects only from the game <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">vantage point</span>. But the players must not offend no one of them and if somebody bumps in some of these object he or she will exit from the game. Every caught object gives one or two points to the player catching hold it dependently of size of the object. In this game we all are rivals for each-other. But we can play with (teams) commands and then the commands will play roles of opponents for each-other."},
      {"Judy": "I have understood that the beings who will serve us as vehicles be responsible for our achievements?"},
      {"Helen": "Of course. This is their game, too. There was such <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">caveat</span> where I read about the games that these beings have not weak <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">vigor what serves them giving <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">aptitudes</span> to quick speed in this game. Also I read they are not being <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">enfeebled</span> during a long game time. So we must hold on tight with them. But if somebody <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">topples</span> it is not so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">tangible</span> negative as <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">bumping</span>. The player who will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">topple</span> be returned back with help of his live vehicle."},
      {"Judy": "Are the <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">dustbins reeking</span>?"},
      {"Helen": "Rather no than yes. They are not natural and the game is played in the water. Besides people who play in this game breath with air stored in the diving helmets, as you know. So they can not feel smell which <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">pertain</span> water."},
      {"Cassandra": "It is very wonderful, but I am a little anxious about these facts <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">pertaining</span> this game."},
      {"Helen": "I will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">mollify</span> your <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">turmoil</span> feelings. I think I have already read about this game and understood that there is no necessity for players of having very strong nerves. You will be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">clutched</span> with the animal with a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">cohesive</span> nexus. The nexuses are used with the purpose of reducing falling possibility. To say more you will not suffer <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">tangibly</span> if you <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">topple</span> from your vehicle. The game will be played in water where anything falls not very quickly. If you reach the bottom in your falling you will not be injured. May be your quick live vehicle will have catch you before you fly to the bottom. You will only have to climb onto its back. Anyway it is a large possibility that you will not be injured because it is going on in water and the nexus are used to help the players to return on their diving spaces. Sometimes it seems to me such game will be an <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">indispensable</span> entertainme."},
      {"Cassandra": "Yes, I think it will be very <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">invigorating</span>. If the marine vehicles moved slowly the game would be less enthralling."},

      {"Cassandra": "The destiny of the world is almost always being decided. Communists, Nazi’s , some other goblins. There is always something, and only science keeps going on despite all troubles. By the way, Is Christian going with us on holidays?"},
      {"Helen": "No, he is not. He is busy with his work deals. He works <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">meticulously</span> and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">obstinately</span> with his subject."},

      {"Helen": "I did not discuss it with Christian. I did not think about it. I do not engage the sciences which he engages and it is not my life. But I hope he will find what to engage after existence of extra-decomposers. Well, do you have something else what you want to know about the game?"},
      {"Cassandra": "How will we <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">clutched</span> to the marine animals? I mean what parts of human bodies are connected with animals?"},
      {"Helen": "A player tightens a nexus around his waist. Also there is a nexus around animal's body. These 2 rings are connected with iron nexuses."},

For certain quantity of <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">jolts</span> they are excepted from the game. It does not refer to the animals because they do not do this according to the rules.

These merpeople are highly extra-ordinary beings. I like dolphins, too, because they are notably clever animals especially the dolphins taking part in this game. They are intellectual to such extent that they are able to play such games. They understand their destination and try to do anything <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">striving</span> to victory what means they are concerned to win like people and merpeople in the game.

I would like know how is Christian and help him with something. I think I have found a clue for his success and I can help. Christian must visit one place where he can reach what he must reach. I would like to tell you about a place where I live now. A man <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">wields</span> a house with a court and an <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immense</span> lake. I live in this lake with <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">raft</span> of other marine inhabitants. Recently I have known something here. Here Christian has an opportunity to know very much about <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">provenance</span> of extra-decomposers. He  must come to the lake, be under the surface of it and talk with me. Here he can know what he cannot know somewhere <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">outwards</span> of this hydrosphere. There is very much impressive regardless <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">provenance</span> of extra-decomposers. Besides there is one creature who is responsible for birth of extra-decomposers. If he and Christian meet each-other he can tell Christian very much about that. But he must not know that Christian considers this <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">appointment</span> his scientific <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">scrutiny</span>. In other words Christian can have <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">appointment</span> with this lake inhabitant as just a guest, but not as a scientist. The devil will not approve a meeting if it is a meeting with a scientist who presumes information from communication with the devil’s to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">play out</span> important role in his scientific career. The devil will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">despise</span> such interlocutor and not speak with him. Besides the human who <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">wields</span> all this estate must not know about Christian’s visit. It is possible to get into the lake by flying on a big strong swan over the fence and gates. Don’t think that it is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unfathomable</span> to get to the domain without host’s invitation or approval. A swan approvals such visits independently from the host. He does not know about the devil living in the lake <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">albeit</span> the lake appertain him like the court and the house.

I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unwittingly impelled</span> to be sold and so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unwittingly</span> I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">impelled</span> to be bought by one family. A little girl covered the surface of their aquarium with a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">lid</span> with the purpose to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hinder</span> my redemption from her. When she took me from the aquarium I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">impelled</span> to serve the girl as a toy. She played with her toys and me as a living toy. I was a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">striking</span> toy for her. She gave me a name. I said I already had a name, but it did not bother her. Sometimes these games were just <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">untenable</span> for me! Mummy of this girl stitched dresses, blouses, skirts and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">slippers</span> for me. The family saw that I did not like live in their aquarium. They wanted take me with themselves to the beach, but afraid that I would run away from them. I remember one time they caged me into a bird cage and strapped the cage to a ball with a rope. They went to a beach with me <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">confined</span> into these implements. Sometimes it looked like I was an <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">inalienable</span> part of life of these children when they had begun take me with themselves to the beach. I had such dream thought that the children would grew up and toys will be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">repealed</span> and may be my freedom would be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">resumed</span>. But there had been one coup of events in result of which I had breached to the will earlier than the children would grow up."]},

      {"Beatriz":["I ate what the children gave me. In the beginning it was such food as fish feed. But some time later the children noticed that I could not eat it. It fell out from me. Soon I got illness. The family <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">summoned</span> a veterinary. Not the first veterinary could explain them what happened with me. I had <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">guessworks</span> regarding my illness, but nobody of the members of the family believed me. The <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">guessworks</span> were that the reason of the illness was that I had eaten not my food. The veterinary said the same and also he said that he could give the family some medical prescriptions to help me. They <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">spurned</span> this idea because they had decided that it would be too inconvenient for them. So they threw me out. Before that I asked the veterinarian if that was possible to me carry about myself without help. The veterinary said that there was necessity to write a long medical prescription. Because of I could not write I had to carry about myself. I had lived in nature without help for some time being ill while the woman-devil took me under her <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">oversaw</span>. She was very useful <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">custodian</span> for me. Maybe she is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">omnipotence</span> and the fact is that she has helped me to recover.

She was closer to an attractive toy than to a horrible monster or a human. Her figure was more similar to a figure of a toy than a human figure. Her head was not less wide than shoulders. Her height was lower than Judy's height. It reached Judy's lips. Eyes were very big and their form was more similar to circles than to form of human eyes. Accordingly to it her edge were so big. Hair was in thick and long scythe ending lower her polly. Accordingly to Judy's feelings Woman-devil's hair were very dense like toy's hair.
