      {"Christian":["I had so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immense</span> inclination as in this life. I conducted <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">inquiries</span> in such scientific area as decomposers. There was one unfavorable case in my job. At one moment I collided with one understandable fact. One day I meet a very strange looking creature in a forest."]},

It was something unimaginably <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">striking</span>. But I have not concluded that it is something <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">superfluous</span> and I <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">purport</span> to find out this secret in my current life. I know now epoch has changed. Such phenomena as extra-decomposers are norm in our epoch unlike the epoch when I lived my in previous life. So I am not thought as about a crazy man."]},

      {"Christian":["It is a story which will seem enough <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">shrill</span> for human perception, but I see you are enough interested. I collided with some special entities when I learnt extra-decomposers. I was a bit shocked but not deeply. The creature looked very surprising. It was just <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">striking</span>! It was like a daemon. It had bright-red eyes glowing in the dark, long clutches and hissed at me!"]},
      {"Cassandra":["It must be you were <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">daunted</span> very much."]},
      {"Christian":["I <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">scarcely</span> did not go mad when I saw it. I turned and run away <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hastily</span> from the forest. It <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">played out</span> very negative role in my life. I told different people about this accident. I could not hold it in my secret. The words about this scene <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">breached</span> textually from me. People decided that I was crazy. So I lost right to engage science after that. I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">confined</span> in a madhouse where I died <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">prematurely</span> from heavy yearning by such reason as science <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">shortage</span>."]},
      {"Judy":["Yes, Christian, you were right. The story is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">shrill</span> really. It is unfair that some unknown creatures <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hinder</span> to success in a scientist’s life and lead them to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">lamentable</span> end."]},
      {"Christian":["So as you know my possibility to continue engaging in science area was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">reinstated</span> when I had been born in this life and become 3 years old."]},
      {"Helen":["What creature was that?"]},
      {"Christian":["In this time we know about such creatures almost nothing. Now they are thought as about real creatures which exist not only in imagination of a crazy person, they also exist <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">outwards</span> of a crazy person’s imagination in real world, but we know that they are somebody like daemons. Now I am working not in night time when it is not so scary."]},
      {"Judy":["It must be you <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">long for</span> to reach and find out it in this your life?"]},
      {"Christian":["Of course, I do. I like <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">pondering</span> nature laws and make new discoveries and improve opened discoveries. Science engagement is an <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">inalienable</span> part of my life. I have <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">epitomized</span> in this my life exactly for this purpose. I just the same can not have this life without it. So I <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">downright</span> do not want be a usual child."]},
      {"Judy":["Is your work successfull now?"]},
      {"Christian":["I evaluate my engagement as successful and meaningful work. Sometimes I am <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">impelled</span> to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">exert</span> my mental forces and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">rack my brains</span> in sciences, but I like it. It is so mysteriously and as if it is enchantingly. But I have not only good news. There are some <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hurdles</span> to the success performing my mission. I do not like people who are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hectic</span> to believe in some unusual phenomena. For example, my granny who is enough <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">incisive</span> person in my life. Sometimes she impedes me to work with her <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hectic unrests</span>."]},
      {"Cassandra":["What does she do what impedes you?"]},
      {"Christian":["She behaves like a crazy <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">superannuated</span> idiot. She almost <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hectically</span> philosophizes that I am a supernatural human and it is not normal. I am fed with her emotional <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">trepidation</span> and I do not know how to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">placate</span> her mood. She <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">scarcely</span> is not going mad. Sometimes it <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">summons resentment</span> in me. It <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">boils down</span> that sometimes she <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hampers</span> my working process and also I <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hinder</span> calm in her life."]},

      {"Christian":["I understand you."]},
      {"Judy":["I listened about <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">dissemination</span> of such specific children as you, Christian. I read about them in papers. There are many children who have such <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">innate</span> aptitudes as you and are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">entitled</span> to work as scientists in so early age. Did you hear about it?"]},
      {"Christian":["Yes, I read in papers. These children have stories like mine. So now I am not the one such child in the world."]},

      {"Beatriz’s letter": ["Hi, Helen. This is Beatriz, the same extra-decomposer in human view which lived in your aquarium some times ago. I hope, you remember me. I would like know how is Christian and help him with something. I think I have found a clue for his success and I can help. Christian must visit one place where he can reach what he must reach. I would like to tell you about a place where I live now. A man <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">wields</span> a house with a court and an <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immense</span> lake. I live in this lake with <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">raft</span> of other marine inhabitants. Recently I have known something here. Here Christian has an opportunity to know very much about <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">provenance</span> of extra-decomposers. He  must come to the lake, be under the surface of it and talk with me. Here he can know what he cannot know somewhere <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">outwards</span> of this hydrosphere. There is very much impressive regardless <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">provenance</span> of extra-decomposers. Besides there is one creature who is responsible for birth of extra-decomposers. If he and Christian meet each-other he can tell Christian very much about that. But he must not know that Christian considers this <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">appointment</span> his scientific <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">scrutiny</span>. In other words Christian can have <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">appointment</span> with this lake inhabitant as just a guest, but not as a scientist. The devil will not approve a meeting if it is a meeting with a scientist who presumes information from communication with the devil’s to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">play out</span> important role in his scientific career. The devil will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">despise</span> such interlocutor and not speak with him. Besides the human who <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">wields</span> all this estate must not know about Christian’s visit. It is possible to get into the lake by flying on a big strong swan over the fence and gates. Don’t think that it is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unfathomable</span> to get to the domain without host’s invitation or approval. A swan approvals such visits independently from the host. He does not know about the devil living in the lake <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">albeit</span> the lake appertain him like the court and the house. This letter was delivered to you by one of the swans which live in the demesne of this human. Anything of these words is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sheer</span> true."]},

At first if it is as I want it to be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">irrefutable</span> with whom I will speak. At second we will not have to wait answers from each-other for some time. I would like to know the following. Did you discuss with the devil what if Christian visits the underwater space where you live and how this devil refers to people? What devil is this about whom you wrote in your letter?

      {"Beatriz":["We will discuss the questions when there will be suitable moment for everybody of you to fly. Let me tell you a story of my life. It is about important events which occurred with me after I had left Helen. I was caught by a human who brought me to a sale. I was sold in a marine pets shop. I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unwittingly impelled</span> to be sold and so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unwittingly</span> I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">impelled</span> to be bought by one family. A little girl covered the surface of their aquarium with a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">lid</span> with the purpose to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hinder</span> my redemption from her. When she took me from the aquarium I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">impelled</span> to serve the girl as a toy. She played with her toys and me as a living toy. I was a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">striking</span> toy for her. She gave me a name. I said I already had a name, but it did not bother her. Sometimes these games were just <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">untenable</span> for me! Mummy of this girl stitched dresses, blouses, skirts and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">slippers</span> for me. The family saw that I did not like live in their aquarium. They wanted take me with themselves to the beach, but afraid that I would run away from them. I remember one time they caged me into a bird cage and strapped the cage to a ball with a rope. They went to a beach with me <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">confined</span> into these implements. Sometimes it looked like I was an <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">inalienable</span> part of life of these children when they had begun take me with themselves to the beach. I had such dream thought that the children would grew up and toys will be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">repealed</span> and may be my freedom would be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">resumed</span>. But there had been one coup of events in result of which I had breached to the will earlier than the children would grow up."]},

      {"Beatriz":["Of course, this life seemed <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">preposterous</span> and meaningless to me. You are completely right. I am in this world with completely other purpose. But there were such circumstances where I pleased by the arm of these kids and become a hostage. They had enough powers to be my <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">overlords</span>."]},
      {"Helen":["This girl was so toad!"]},
      {"Beatriz":["I am agree <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">altogether</span> with you. But people like money very much. The bigger gain is the more satisfied people are. So they caught and took me to the shop of those considerations that I can bring them success as demanded merchandise."]},
      {"Judy":["Selfish! You, poor little helpless being! This story really cost <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">contempt</span> for them!"]},
      {"Helen":["Yes, really. What you have transferred us is that really <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">conjures seething</span> of quicks! Did these people feed you with carrion?"]},
      {"Beatriz":["No, they did not. I can eat not only carrion."]},
      {"Helen":["What did you eat when you lived in this cage?"]},
      {"Beatriz":["I ate what the children gave me. In the beginning it was such food as fish feed. But some time later the children noticed that I could not eat it. It fell out from me. Soon I got illness. The family <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">summoned</span> a veterinary. Not the first veterinary could explain them what happened with me. I had <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">guessworks</span> regarding my illness, but nobody of the members of the family believed me. The <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">guessworks</span> were that the reason of the illness was that I had eaten not my food. The veterinary said the same and also he said that he could give the family some medical prescriptions to help me. They <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">spurned</span> this idea because they had decided that it would be too inconvenient for them. So they threw me out. Before that I asked the veterinarian if that was possible to me carry about myself without help. The veterinary said that there was necessity to write a long medical prescription. Because of I could not write I had to carry about myself. I had lived in nature without help for some time being ill while the woman-devil took me under her <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">oversaw</span>. She was very useful <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">custodian</span> for me. Maybe she is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">omnipotence</span> and the fact is that she has helped me to recover. I was very thankful to her. But now I don't like my life in the lake with her. She is my <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">overlord</span>. Now I have a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">grander undertaking</span> before the woman-devil to serve her and I can not dare to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">rebuff</span> from my <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">responsibility</span> before her."]},
      {"Judy":["Is it true that she allowed you to go to a far distance from her?"]},
      {"Beatriz":["Yes, it is, but if she does not waited me till soon moment of time her <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">incense</span> will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">rage</span> and she will fly for me here and find me."]},
      {"Helen":["May I ask a question related with the idea regarding your cure which was suggested by the veterinary?"]},
      {"Beatriz":["Of course, you may."]},
      {"Helen":["You could not write and there was necessity to write very much. These 2 facts were the reason why you could not solve the question about your recovery independently. I think your hosts could write. If it is true then I have such question: could they take to themselves writing and in the same time you take to yourself the cure?"]},
      {"Beatriz":["These people had to go they did not know where to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">mine</span> some medical facilities. We did not know where is a forest with such plants. Besides I needed carrion. They did not want cook me feed of carrion. It was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">abhorrent</span> for them. Besides they thought that to let me fly <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">outwards</span> of their living space and to reckon that I would continue life in their aquarium are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">irreconcilable</span> in the same time. They thought that if they had released me I would have run away from them. So they decided to let me fly to freedom."]},

She was closer to an attractive toy than to a horrible monster or a human. Her figure was more similar to a figure of a toy than a human figure. Her head was not less wide than shoulders. Her height was lower than Judy's height. It reached Judy's lips. Eyes were very big and their form was more similar to circles than to form of human eyes. Accordingly to it her edge were so big. Hair was in thick and long scythe ending lower her polly. Accordingly to Judy's feelings Woman-devil's hair were very dense like toy's hair. Her polly was visibly wider than the part of her body from shoulders till waist. Woman-devil was closed in a dark swimsuit and dark cloak on her  back. Beatriz presented her and Judy to each-other."]},

      {"Woman-devil": ["This is a very clever postulation. I can tell you, Judy, more about myself. I really have great magical forces and create my extra-decomposers through them. I gave them such title as extra-decomposers. I gqve Beatriz life. I did not create her, but I remade her. She was very ill and dead. I freed her from illness, turned her into alive, but sleepy human. After that I reduced her, added her respiratory system to breathe water and rolled up in a cocoon, created through my magical forces. Some time later I launched the cocoon. Beatriz woke up with these pretty and bright wigs and horns like wigs and horns of a butterfly. We greeted each-other and told about themselves. After that I allowed her to fly and live everywhere where she wanted. When I and Beatriz had met again she told me about her life in the your friend's aquarium, ocean, swamp and the aquarium of those <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">abhorrent</span> people. Now she has the debt in front of me - to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">play out</span> a role of an extra-decomposer, because I helped her to aquire life 2 times. I can endue animals consciousness. So I have endued some snakes and swans. Now they understand what I want from them like people. So some swans can serve us as postmen. So I and Beatriz <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">penned</span> when Beatriz lived in the acquarium of your friend. Besides, as you, maybe know, I am here with one serious purpose."]},

If Judy can not plunge under water with us lets not to torment ourselves with this disadvantage. We can have a wonderful time out of the ocean."]},

      {"Woman-devil": ["No, you are not <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">entirely</span> right. There was no invitation to go to lake. There was only my suggestion to visit a part of ocean. I, Beatriz and many other animals now live in ocean. We have our <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">confined</span> with a border part in ocean. There a lot  of other different marine animals live in this part with us. We are a big friendly company. Moreover, I was born in the bottom of the ocean. There I have been living during whole my life."]},

I had only such suggestion for you as to visit our part of ocean and see our world. But because you can not to admit this suggestion, I and Beatriz will tell you about our world. It is Pacific ocean and we have to live there near its <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">banks</span> because there are some dishonest people living right there. The nature is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">contaminated</span> very much. The <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">banks</span> are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">contaminated</span> too much with different litter and yuck. It is really <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">appallingly</span> and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">abhorrent</span>! But I see so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">incentive</span> to work in my wonderful guys extra-decomposers as it must be. I am very glad how they do what they must do."]},

      {"Woman-devil": ["The border is a steal high thick lattice with big cells. It is a very high lattice and was built by me with help of many marine animals. I can negotiate with different marine animals. There are no predators in our <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">confined</span> world. It is very peaceful there. We negotiated to separate the space  and live separately from predatory animals. The space is enough <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">far-flung</span> and it is spaciously for us including Beatriz who does not like little close space. The lattice is only about 1 meter not enough to the surface of the ocean."]},

The cocoon hangs on a branch of a very big and strong wood. When I wake up I unwrap the cocoon and have big wigs and horns like a butterfly. I can fly moving my wigs so much as I want.

Now I am answering your last  question. You asked how my magic forces are related with strength of the fencing. So I am explaining  you, but at first I must say that it may be very puzzling for you. You as a human may not understand  much. I hope you will be satisfied by the information which you will get from me. Well, what is related  with my forces and this lattce - both are related in reality. Forces like mine let make buildings very  buxom.

I remember only such facts that it had red burning in darkness eyes and clutches. Christian was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">daunted</span> with it. So he has <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">abdicated</span> from his engagement and run away from the forest. After that he had <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">tangible</span> troubles in his life. He was taken for a madman."]},
