      {"Judy": ["I am happy to meet you, Christian."]},
      {"Cassandra": ["Me too. Yes, Christian, you produce extraordinary impression! You are really a phenomenon! The way you look like is completely different from what you are in your mind.  Your mind is not that of a child of the age you look like! Mentally you are completely not a child of the age in which you appear to be! And it is so stunning!"]},
      {"Christian": ["Yes, I understand you. Our occupation is so important to us, scientists, that sometimes we have to continue it in our next life. It is worth of preserving  your entire memory from your previous life and of continuing your work as if your present life were a continuation of the previous one. Girls, tell me about you, what are you doing and what interests you now."]},
      {"Judy": ["I think you know about our interests. I know that Helen told you about us."]},
      {"Cassandra": ["We are interested in various things."]},
      {"Christian": ["Yes, Helen told me about you. But when we meet for the first time, it is important for me to ask you what can you tell about yourself."]},
      {"Judy": ["I am studying at the economic faculty of a university. I entered the university not quite on my own will. Cassandra is studying  to become a photographer now."]},
      {"Christian": ["I am a biologist. As you know I did not get education in this life and anon began engaging professional scientific activity. I got all my knowledges in my previous life and I was born in this life to continue my scientific activity anonymously and to do what I could not do in my previous life."]},
      {"Cassandra": ["We heard about this from Helen and we were excited by this. It seems you know how rare it is when a human understands reality around him like an adult soon after his birth."]},
      {"Christian": ["Yes, I agree, it is a nonsense. We can talk and talk about it. Let’s discuss another thing now. I heard there was a new marine pet as a present for Helen."]},
      {"Helen": ["Exactly. She is a cruise mermaid or a marine butterfly with a human body. The pet is very unusual. I have never had  such pets. She swims in water and flies in air like a butterfly. She <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sways</span> with her wings both in water and air and moves in this way. Her wings are like wings of a butterfly."]},
      {"Cassandra": ["Yes, she is very unusual. I have never had such pets too. But she does not have a tail like a tail of a mermaid. So we can not call her a natural mermaid."]},
      {"Helen": ["I have made her an artificial tail of tissues in order to her to be more <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">akin</span> a mermaid."]},
      {"Judy": ["I have never seen such creatures earlier in my life and so I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">overwhelmed</span> by meeting with such creature as Beatrix. It was most extraordinary and unusual to see such a creature. A chair <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">shattered</span> under me from surprise."]},
      {"Cassandra": ["I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">overwhelmed</span> too, but still I did not go mad. Later I heard how this creature spoke human language! It was something amazing to such extent! It is a not quite human creature and completely unknown to us and though it can speak! It is a special innovation!"]},
      {"Helen": ["Yes, all of us were <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">overwhelmed</span>. But Beatrix's suggestion that she was going to live in my aquarium did not caused any objections in me. Judy, Cassandra and me - we all were <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">overwhelmed</span>, but somehow I liked Beatrix because she is such an unusual creature. Beatrix said you knew that I would like her and so you wanted her to live in my house."]},
      {"Christian": ["Here I can <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">appease</span> and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\"> mollify</span> you. My grandpa has carefully washed her in a clean water with soap and brush. Afterwards she has not been in a swamp any more. Right after washing  we brought her to you. During the trip she sit at grandpa’s shoulder right before she came to you and Judy and Cassandra. Therefore, there is no reason to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">disdain</span> her so much. She did not immediately fly dirty from the swamp to you."]},
      {"Judy": ["But when she climbed  the table, Helen was almost fail into a rage. She gave her a sharp command: go away. Beatrix responded to leap off the table into my lap. And my reaction to this leap was to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\"> teeter</span> and to tremble! This reaction was provoked way of being, an unusual and unfamiliar to my perception. And, moreover, I had a feeling that this wonder has jumped on me. I was aware that it was out of the swamp. All these factors together have provoked my wild reaction to this creature touching me."]},
      {"Christian": ["But now you do know, that there was nothing  to worry about."]},
      {"Judy": ["I agree with this. But I did not know that it was washed and disinfected. In my reaction I angrily casted her away, and now I regret about it."]},
      {"Cassandra": ["And who has called her?"]},
      {"Christian": ["I don’t know. When my grandpa has caught her, she already had the name. So, listen to an important message. I believe that keeping at home such creatures as Beatrix can be quite a problem for their survival. These creatures have primitive intellect with which they do not completely understand their danger. Beatrix can crawl from the aquarium not awaring the danger for her existence in such a moment when you are not near her. She would like to walk, fly and hunt insects. In that case she can became a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">booty</span> of your dog or some other dog."]},
      {"Cassandra": ["Helen understands all this. She has talked with Beatrix about it. And she told her to stay in the aquarium when she is away."]},
      {"Christian": ["Beatrix is such creature whose brain is more primitive than human brain. She is not so aware of danger as a clever human would be. That is why I think it is necessary to cover your aquarium so that Beatrix will not fly away without you noticing if you want her to be all right. It is the right idea to put something on the surface of your aquarium. But this idea has a bad side."]},
      {"Helen": ["Cassandra  offered me her iron window lattice but I don’t like this idea. I reckoned that it will not work. Cells of this lattice, must be, big enough for Beatrix to come though and crawl through them. That is why we decided it will be better for Beatrix to stay away from the surface and crawl only when I will give her a signal that it is safe."]},
      {"Christian": ["But I still think you should not renounce <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">abdicate (abandon?)</span> from the idea to cover the surface of the marine hole. Given the fact that the mind of such a creature like Beatrix, walling up the aquarium may seem to reassure you to do anything else. Of course, it must be something that contains holes in itself but not big enough so that the inhabitants of the aquarium couldn’t get out. But on other hand Beatrix needs to hunt insects and she will have to get out from the aquarium and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">soar</span> over the vegetable garden to do this. But to leave Beatrix without keeping an eye on her when she is away from  the marine aquarium is dangerous for her life. Will you follow her every time when she flies out of her habitats?"]},
      {"Helen": ["Probably I will have to."]},
      {"Christian": ["That is the inconvenience of keeping creatures of  such species in the house. If you are sure Beatrix won’t fly from the aquarium at a random moment it is your fault. You must understand her desire to look at the world around her out of this little habitat. Therefore you must <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">deliberately</span> create <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hurdles</span> so that  her desire cannot be realized at any moment."]},
      {"Helen": ["I will seek something what can be used as a cover."]},
      {"Christian": ["This will go against some of her desires but this is still for the sake of her more important interest."]},
      {"Judy": ["How can you allow your dog to drink from the aquarium populated with living creatures? It seems to me you <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">derail</span> the fates of your marine pets and ignore them."]},
      {"Helen": ["I disagree with this. I know Junior is smart enough to understand that these are living creatures and my pets. Besides I can say he drinks from the aquarium rather rarely and only during the warm season. Often he drinks from his drinker. There can be different water level in the aquarium. I can pour such a low level that Junior won’t reach the surfac."]},
      {"Christian": ["But since you keep Beatrix you need to take aquarium security more carefully in connection with what I have already explained you about your new pet."]},
      {"Helen": ["I have answered you about the rest of my pets. I will make the level of water so low that Junior will not reach the surface and I will train him to drink from his drinker. Sometimes I feel it before I go somewhere so that Junior will not run away from the yard."]},
      {"Judy": ["Does he understand why you do it? He won’t be confused?"]},
      {"Helen": ["All my acquaintances tie their dogs sometimes when they think it is important. I have some important arguments to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">compel</span> Junior to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">abdicate</span> freedom of movement and chose another place for recreation instead of the booth. Do you know why?"]},
      {"Cassandra": ["What are your clever dog’s <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">merits</span> in missing freedom?"]},
      {"Helen": ["Often it happened that when I am not home he runs away somewhere from the yard for a walk. In some lucky cases Junior comes back home not too late. But when I am not lucky he has spent dead of night, scratches and barks at the gate. I have to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">abdicate</span> from slow recreation and go to meet Junior."]},
      {"Cassandra": ["And it happens like this: your clever dog is not aware that his interests interfere with the interests of its hosts."]},
      {"Helen": ["Unfortunately it happens so. I open the gate for him, he enters and I tell him: “Have you spent? It is curious what did you look for during this long period. Do you go to reproduce or look for some other dogs with whom to chat or flirt? But whatever you engaged in I want think about the interests of your hosts. If you go away somewhere you must be back before 10 o’clock. If you don’t follow the rules you will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">solicit</span> restrictions of your freedom”."]},
      {"Cassandra": ["Did Junior repeat this mistake after that?"]},
      {"Helen": ["Sadly, yes."]},
      {"Judy": ["Do you see? You got the argument to admit that your dog does not understand or at least does not always understand human statements regarding what is allowed to him and what is not. We can have close conversation regarding your marine pets. We can conclude that hope that Junior would understand that he has to avoid touching them is naive. It will be safer if they will stay out of his reach."]},
      {"Helen": ["But I noticed Junior is clever when there is a case with the marine population. He has never eaten even small pets."]},
      {"Cassandra": ["It is appropriate to keep away  from the surface of the marine zone. But it is not <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">nuff said</span> for Beatrix. It refers to your other marine pets. And I still think it will be sanely if you listen to Christian and do not stick to your own opinion. It is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">akin</span> Christian is smarter than your Junior."]},
      {"Helen": ["Have you something else to advise me as a cover to the aquarium?"]},
      {"Cassandra": ["No, I don’t  unfortunately."]},
      {"Christian": ["I can give you a net. It is a piece of an old fence which stayed in the yard of my ancestors. And I think it will be better if we are going to me right now and give this part of the fence and later we go to you and secure Beatrix’s life and later all together gather here again and continue the conversation. I engage <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">inquiries</span> in the wildlife area and can tell you about the species to which Beatrix belongs."]},
      {"Helen": ["It is wonderful!"]},
      {"Christian": ["But at first we will go to you and wall up your hollow. It is unacceptable to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">postpone</span> such a task.  As soon as we do we will have a greater chance to protect Beatrix."]},
      {"Helen": ["Then, girls, let’s say good bye. Christian and me are leaving soon."]},
      {"Christian": ["During the trip I am going to tell you what you will have to feed to Beatrix. The feed that you give to your fishes is not her food."]},
      {"Judy": ["Christian, you yourself are innovation and besides, the fact that you discover such creatures as Beatrix, it is amazing!"]},
      {"Cassandra": ["We were <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">struck</span> by the story about you which Helen told us and now we are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">struck</span> by the innovation regarding your scientific deeds!"]},

As I have already said I lived in the swamp in the ocean after that and in the river the at last time. I <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">mined</span> feed for myself.

The game is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">carried out</span> in huge aquariums in the museums of Miami. There are many different games which are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">carried out</span> in the <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immense</span> aquariums. The players are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">entitled</span> to put on diving suits and get into the aquariums where they take part of the game. Every player takes a basket before game starting. When I read about them in magazines, I had such impression that they are akin some sport games. I read about not to say <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immense plethora</span> of games but I am very interested of them and I think you will like it, too. I can tell you about some of those games in particular. Many of them have similarities. It is that they are based on quick movement in the water. The principle is following. We <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">plunge</span> into water and sit on the backs of dolphins and merpeople and wear to them with <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">cohesive</span> chains. There will be some bright objects quickly moving in different directions in the water discarded by a game leader. We <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">purport</span> to catch the objects earlier than our foes. So our marine inhabitants will serve us as a vehicles. They will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sweep</span> in the water and their purpose is to obtain such <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">vantage point</span> where we can reach out our hand and touch the object. We will have to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">strive</span> reach the object and touch it according to our purpose and put it in the basket. So we <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">purport</span> to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">muster</span> as many objects as we can. There will be some <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hurdles</span> for the movement to be easy in hurry. There will be such <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hurdles</span> as some objects we will must <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sweep</span> past and not offend. The objects will be such as <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">dustbins</span> and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">rattlesnakes</span>, but they will be not natural. They are only called so. They are such objects only from the game <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">vantage point</span>. But the players must not offend no one of them and if somebody bumps in some of these object he or she will exit from the game. Every caught object gives one or two points to the player catching hold it dependently of size of the object. In this game we all are rivals for each-other. But we can play with (teams) commands and then the commands will play roles of opponents for each-other."

Also I read they are not being <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">enfeebled</span> during a long game time. So we must hold on tight with them. But if somebody <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">topples</span> it is not so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">tangible</span> negative as <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">bumping</span>.

I would like to tell you about a place where I live now. A man <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">wields</span> a house with a court and an <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immense</span> lake. I live in this lake with <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">raft</span> of other marine inhabitants. Recently I have known something here. Here Christian has an opportunity to know very much about <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">provenance</span> of extra-decomposers. He  must come to the lake, be under the surface of it and talk with me. Here he can know what he cannot know somewhere <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">outwards</span> of this hydrosphere. There is very much impressive regardless <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">provenance</span> of extra-decomposers. Besides there is one creature who is responsible for birth of extra-decomposers. If he and Christian meet each-other he can tell Christian very much about that. But he must not know that Christian considers this <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">appointment</span> his scientific <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">scrutiny</span>. In other words Christian can have <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">appointment</span> with this lake inhabitant as just a guest, but not as a scientist. The devil will not approve a meeting if it is a meeting with a scientist who presumes information from communication with the devil’s to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">play out</span> important role in his scientific career. The devil will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">despise</span> such interlocutor and not speak with him. Besides the human who <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">wields</span> all this estate must not know about Christian’s visit. It is possible to get into the lake by flying on a big strong swan over the fence and gates. Don’t think that it is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unfathomable</span> to get to the domain without host’s invitation or approval. A swan approvals such visits independently from the host. He does not know about the devil living in the lake <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">albeit</span> the lake appertain him like the court and the house.

They went to a beach with me <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">confined</span> into these implements.

I had <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">guessworks</span> regarding my illness, but nobody of the members of the family believed me. The <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">guessworks</span> were that the reason of the illness was that I had eaten not my food. The veterinary said the same and also he said that he could give the family some medical prescriptions to help me. They <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">spurned</span> this idea because they had decided that it would be too inconvenient for them. So they threw me out. Before that I asked the veterinarian if that was possible to me carry about myself without help. The veterinary said that there was necessity to write a long medical prescription. Because of I could not write I had to carry about myself. I had lived in nature without help for some time being ill while the woman-devil took me under her <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">oversaw</span>. She was very useful <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">custodian</span> for me. Maybe she is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">omnipotence</span> and the fact is that she has helped me to recover.

She looked like Beatrix described her in  the conversation with Judy and her friends. But Woman-devil was a bit like an ugly scarecrow. Also she was not very similar to a human. She was closer to an attractive toy than to a horrible monster or a human. Her figure was more similar to a figure of a toy than a human figure. Her head was not less wide than shoulders. Her height was lower than Judy's height. It reached Judy's lips. Eyes were very big and their form was more similar to circles than to form of human eyes. Accordingly to it her edge were so big. Hair was in thick and long scythe ending lower her polly. Accordingly to Judy's feelings Woman-devil's hair were very dense like toy's hair. Her polly was visibly wider than the part of her body from shoulders till waist. It seemed <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">daunt</span> to  Judy. She did not like it at the first moment. But Woman-devil smiled friendly and kindly very soon since the first moment when Judy watched at her face. At this moment Judy's perception was changed colossaly. She was surprised how she could perceive Woman-devil's face negatively. Even when her smile had dissapeared from her face Judy was continuing to perceive Woman-devil's face very positively. Woman-devil was closed in a dark swimsuit and dark cloak on her  back. Beatrix presented her and Judy to each-other."

After that I reduced her, added her respiratory system to breathe water and rolled up in a cocoon, created through my magical forces. Some time later I launched the cocoon. Beatrix woke up with these pretty and bright wigs and horns like wigs and horns of a butterfly. We greeted each-other and told about themselves. After that I allowed her to fly and live everywhere where she wanted. When I and Beatrix had met again she told me about her life in the your friend's aquarium, ocean, swamp and the aquarium of those <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">abhorrent</span> people. Now she has the debt in front of me - to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">play out</span> a role of an extra-decomposer, because I helped her to aquire life 2 times. I can endue animals consciousness.

At least it had melded. And surface of the body was naked. The criminals go closer to the hole where the ice had melded. They wait while the eyes would be opened for a little time.

The other 3 criminals aimed their weapons on the brute and shot. But by the moment when bullets flew the brute had been jumped highly. The bullets hit in laying criminal. Next moment the brute landed on his body and turned around. The criminals released the bullets again and the brute jumped higly again so that the bullets flew under it. The brure landed and flew on the criminals, glaring its clutches into faces of 2 of them. It threw them on the floor. Its paw with clutches were poked into face of 1 of them and the second paw with clutches was poked in face of the second.

The <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">jarring</span> was from shot of the 5th criminal and the animal was so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">artful</span> that bullet did not catch in it. The bullet flew under the brute at the moment when it was in its jump. In a few moments the brute jumped from water again and flew on 2 rest people.

The brute <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">bumped</span> into their faces with its big and sharp clutches and threw these people on the floor. Faces of all the criminals were bleeded from very deep scratches. Poor criminals cried very loadly from hard pain which was taken them by clutches of the brute. They have already lost their forces to fight. At this moment the brute scratched them more in different places on their bodies. The criminals felt themselves worse from this pain additional. They cried very load from this terrible pain. The brute was scratching them not very long. It went from them soon, but their blood was spreading more and more. After the brute had left these people they were dead. The brute was transformed into a woman before exiting from the temple. The woman was going straight from the building and there was a moment when there was another one criminal behind her.  He was staying not far from the temple and noticed her when she was going beside him.

He released bullet from its weapon. The woman felt air <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">teetering</span> under her back and very acutely fell on the floor. The bullet flew over her.
