            <h4>Lilian</h4>
            <p>Good, Lady Devil. I spent these days in the aquarium of my host, communicated with her friends
             They all met me with goodwill. We talked about my proposal as you know.
            Besides I communicated with animals in Helen's aquarium before my communication with the people.

            <p>Of course, I do. But, frankly, they do not differ <span class="from_vocabulary">tangibly</span> from

            <h4>Lilian</h4>
            <p>Yes, I am serious. I communicated with the animals in ocean about my life in the swamp. I talked with
            the animals Helen's aquarium to the same topic. I told them the same what I told the animals in the
            ocean. I think both categories of the animals were interested in the same extent.</p>

        <div class="words_of_char inobject">
            <h4>Woman-devil</h4>
            <p>It means there is no <span class="from_vocabulary">tangible</span>difference between your conversation
            with the animals of one category and other one. But I have not seen yet any difference between the animals
            in your narrative. Maybe you wanted say that there is simillarity between them which is that all of them
            are equally friendly and interested in the same questions regarding to you?</p>

        <div class="words_of_char inobject">
            <h4>Lilian</h4>
            <p>I do not know how to say to be true. I communicated with all of them almost to the same theme. I told
                them almost the same about myself and my last life in the swamp. It is about what I communicated with
                them. I communicated with them about something com[letely other not so much.

            <p>I have no doubts that if we talk exactly about the inhabitants and not about something other what may
                be related with them, for example, what your communication with them. we can notice that many of them
                are completely different: their view, body structure, nutrition and lifestyle - the difference is
                very obvious.

            <p> Yes, really, they are a terrific life specie. But there is explaination how can they be able to do what
                representatives of other species can not do. Human nature is a terrific thing. It is not what is nature of the special marine creature like you. There is
                such conception as human psychology. Besides there is such fact that human life goes on not in the same world
                where your life goes on, what is a very important circumstance. You live calm life in this paradise world
                compared with scary life of some people. Life of people is very rich with different events what there is no
                telling about life of such marine animals as you. The events of which human life consist are very different
                and can be characterized as something <span class="from_vocabulary">antithetical</span>. There are such events
                and factors among them which can <span class="from_vocabulary">tangibly</span> influence on a human. Human
                mind is formed under influence of these factors. I know Quentin's storie which is about how has he become an
