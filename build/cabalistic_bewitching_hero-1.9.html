            But I read about extra-decomposers, the species you belong to. It was written extra-decomposers can do that. Why you think you can not?

            I can speak with scientists and know how you can change your size. But I am a bit surprised listening from you that you do not know. So who must know?

            Beatrix, what is wrong with you? What  <span class="from_vocabulary">whims</span> have gone on you? Do you know you can change your size to a human size? So you will can play this game.

        <strong data-person="Beatrix">

        <p>
            Sorry, Helen, but I can  <span class="from_vocabulary">praise</span> how I live in your aquarium in no way. It can seem like  <span class="from_vocabulary">whims</span>, but these are not  <span class="from_vocabulary">whims</span> really.

        <p>
            I understand you why you want to leave this place and why it is not suitable  <span class="from_vocabulary">haven</span> for you. There are 2 facts about you such as your world vision and your destination in this world. I know the space in my tank is not so  <span class="from_vocabulary">far-flung</span>. Maybe there is no place enough  <span class="from_vocabulary">far-flung</span> for you, because you have  <span class="from_vocabulary">insatiable fervor</span> to see the world. Besides the fact that the aquarium is a  <span class="from_vocabulary">confined</span> space, also the animals are in  <span class="from_vocabulary">confined</span> quantity in it. So it is  <span class="from_vocabulary">utterly</span> unsuitable  <span class="from_vocabulary">haven</span> for you. It may be applicable only as a temporary habitat. An ocean where there is huge  <span class="from_vocabulary">plethora</span> of different beings is another thing. Other fact is that you are a scavenger and you have the mission which is an  <span class="from_vocabulary">inalienable</span> part of your life. In the same time life in my tank and performing your mission are 2  <span class="from_vocabulary">irreconcilable</span> things. Anything of this is understandable for me. Of course I will part with you when you want.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Beatrix">
            Beatrix

        <p>
            Thank you, Helen, for your concern to me! I think I will miss you to a certain degree, but my nature  <span class="from_vocabulary">compells</span> me to abandon you though I do not want you to feel  <span class="from_vocabulary">dejection</span> about my leaving you.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Helen">
            Helen

        <p>
            The reasons of it are  <span class="from_vocabulary">irrefutable</span> for me. You have already explained me, Christian has, too. I know he is a human who deals with extra-decomposers in his everyday life. But I am interested in the question about growing your size and your possibility to take part with us in the game in our holidays. I am not sure we can  <span class="from_vocabulary">repeal</span> this idea right now by not talking with Christain.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Beatrix">
            Beatrix

        <p>
            Sorry, Helen. I am going to  <span class="from_vocabulary">rebuff</span> it. It refers to my mission again.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Helen">
            Helen

        <p>
            I hoped we would have a cool time. Why you are telling that I have to abolish this positive idea? Do you think the cool  <span class="from_vocabulary">unwinding</span> times will  <span class="from_vocabulary">derail</span> it?
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Beatrix">
            Beatrix

        <p>
            Helen, I want you to understand me correctly. I do not want  <span class="from_vocabulary">foster resentment</span> in you or  <span class="from_vocabulary">incense</span> you. I do not have intentions to  <span class="from_vocabulary">impose dejection</span> on you. The idea is that it is my  <span class="from_vocabulary">commitment</span> to  <span class="from_vocabulary">attend</span> in common world. I can not  <span class="from_vocabulary">afford</span> to stay on your aquarium too long. The enormous <span class="from_vocabulary">superflous</span> pollution is the fact which is most important now. There is  <span class="from_vocabulary">immense raft</span> of carrion poisoning nature availability of which can lead to catastophic  <span class="from_vocabulary">aftermaths</span> which I must  <span class="from_vocabulary">confront</span> as you know. There are many other decomposers who is performing this mission, but I must take part in it, too. I must go and  <span class="from_vocabulary">fullfill</span> my mission. It is not desirable to  <span class="from_vocabulary">postpone</span> this. I do not have it right now, but I do not have to continue life in your aquarium too long.

        <p>
            Now I understand you. I understand it is a real  <span class="from_vocabulary">favour</span> that you have  <span class="from_vocabulary">aptitudes</span> to  <span class="from_vocabulary">sway</span> to our  <span class="from_vocabulary">contaminated</span> world. Of course, I can not  <span class="from_vocabulary">confront</span> to realization of your intentions. With all of these facts I am releasing you. It must be you will have to exert  <span class="from_vocabulary">fulfilling</span> your  <span class="from_vocabulary">mission</span>.

            It is nice looking in the aquarium. It is made masterfully: these pretty castle of the  <span class="from_vocabulary">flagstones</span>, bottom, location of the stones and algas. Anything of these is pleasing look. But other thing - size of the space.

            Near the swamp where I lived earlier. There is what I have to do near the swamp to  <span class="from_vocabulary">reinstate</span> nature balance. Seems to me there are some  <span class="from_vocabulary">superfluously contaminated</span> places near the swamp.

            All right. But we will need Sam's assistance again. Seems to me we can go to the swamp successfully not  <span class="from_vocabulary">longering</span> only when he has enough free time to help us. Otherwise it will be more difficult to go to the swamp through public transport. It will be  <span class="from_vocabulary">hampered</span> because we do not  <span class="from_vocabulary">wield tangible</span> experience moving over such long distances.

            If you think so I hope we will have opportunity to do as you suggest with Sam's assistance. But I hope we will can go without somebody's help in a pinch.
