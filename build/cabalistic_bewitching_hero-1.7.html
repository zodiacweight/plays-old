        My parents are in New York where we had been living until they divorced. My mother works in New York as a secretary. My dad is in a hospital. He has not good health. As you know I live here with my grandma and grandpa. I do my work as a professional scientist. I work with live nature. How are Judy and Cassandra?

        Judy is a little <span class="from_vocabulary">hectic</span> about her studying. The subjects she learns are not very easy for <span class="from_vocabulary">internalization</span>. She is a little nervous about her exams.

    <p>
        We are going to go to the swamp where Beatrix lived earlier. I am going to by a map where I can see and learn ways to the swamp. We will go here and Beatrix will see her best friend whom she is missing. It seems her desire to see her friend is <span class="from_vocabulary">amplifying</span> every day. I want it happened too. Recently I felt <span class="from_vocabulary">dejection</span> when I thought Beatrix had died. I saw her laying on the bottom of my aquarium and wrapped into her wigs. Fortunately, I was wrong. it was a <span class="from_vocabulary">dormancy</span>, not <span class="from_vocabulary">demise</span>.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Christian">
        Christian

    <p>
        Did you feed her according to how I told you?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen

    <p>
        Yes, of course. It was not very pleasant to make feed of carrion but what could I do other?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Christian">
        Christian
    </strong>
    <p>
        Do you see? Such beings are not intended to be kept in an aquarium of a human. But Beatrix wanted to live in your aquarium for some time and so you had to <span class="from_vocabulary">take</span> her <span class="from_vocabulary">over</span>. I think she will leave you soon because she has to live in nature and perform her mission. It is what she was created for.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">

        Thank you. You told me earlier about such creatures as Beatrix. I was impressed. I am glad you have so interesting job. We can speak about it else.

    <strong data-person="Christian">
        Christian

    <p>
        Yes, it is true that Beatrix is completely extraordinary being. Besides the species is very unusual in the same time Beatrix is very unusual representative of this species. I have already said you that it is a species of decomposers. It appeared when it had became a necessaty in the world. It differs from all the other species in our world. It is a special kind of decomposers. It is a <span class="from_vocabulary">grander</span> secret of nature. These creatures do not reproduce unlike all the other live species. There is no such fact that their dissapearing doubtlessly will <span class="from_vocabulary">turn out</span> a disastrous. It would can happen if they dissapeared at the moment. They exist when there is a necessaty in their existence and do not exist when there is no necessaty. They do not have to reproduce. Nature generates them and there are no such concepts as <span class="from_vocabulary">forebears</span> and descendants in their nature. They exist at such moments when there is <span class="from_vocabulary">wholesale</span> pollution in nature. It <span class="from_vocabulary">implies</span> such pollution level in nature when all the existing decomposers are not enough to <span class="from_vocabulary">cope with</span> such quantity of <span class="from_vocabulary">litter</span>. These creatures are additional decomposers and their function is <span class="from_vocabulary">refinement</span> the <span class="from_vocabulary">contaminated</span> plots of nature from the excess of carrion. The carrion is their main <span class="from_vocabulary">livelihoods</span>. They are extra-decomposers, unbelieveable specific live species.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        Anything of this is so interesting! It is really unusual including the fact that they appear not from their <span class="from_vocabulary">forbears</span>. Bodies of representatives of all the live species are formed as a result of male and female cells <span class="from_vocabulary">junction</span>. It is a well-known nature law. In the same time bodies of these unusual creatures formed as a result of something another.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Christian">
        Christian
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yes, so it is. Their <span class="from_vocabulary">provenance</span> is very unusual. They are formed under secret force influence of nature. But there are some other live organisms which appear not from their <span class="from_vocabulary">forebears</span>. As you understand Beatrix is not for living in an aquarium of somebody as a pet. She is for performing functions of a nature <span class="from_vocabulary">janitor</span>. She was interested to see live in an aquarium because she has human mind but she did not presume it would be forever. So the aquarium is only temporary <span class="from_vocabulary">haven</span> for her. You can let go her from your aquarium in any moment and live in the swamp.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen

    <p>
        I will miss her. She is so extra-ordinary.

    <strong data-person="Christian">

    <p>
        But I have explained you. You have to feed her with carrion. Do you remember that?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yes, I remember. I put gloves on my hands and a swathe with a cloth on my nose before give her the feed. I have died mices and insects, rent bodies of died mices and feed Beatrix in parts. I <span class="from_vocabulary">deflate</span> Beatrix from the aquarium and she eats only out of it with such intention it not to be to the <span class="from_vocabulary">detriment</span> of clean water in the aquarium and other pets.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Mrs Jakins">

        I would not <span class="from_vocabulary">tinker</span> with her and this <span class="from_vocabulary">frigging</span> feed at all.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        But we are speaking about me, not about you. I hope she will not live in the ocean because it may be <span class="from_vocabulary">perilous</span> for her. There are many predatory marine animals in the ocean.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Christian">
        Christian
    </strong>
    <p>
        Helen, do you know that Beatrix is poisonous? But there are not reason for you to be <span class="from_vocabulary">anxious</span>. I <span class="from_vocabulary">warrant</span> you there is no <span class="from_vocabulary">threat</span> for you and your pets from Beatrix. She may be dangerous for predatory animals. She can poison space with a predator around her and kill the predator. Beatrix has bright color of wigs and it is the sign that she is poisonous. Many of predatory animals understand it and they will not <span class="from_vocabulary">assault</span> her. This species is not for becoming victims for predators. So they have natural abilities to protect themselves from them. Besides nature has coined it in such way that predators do not have to became victims too. There must not be carrion clogging <span class="from_vocabulary">exacerbation</span> in nature what is value of existence of these extra-decomposers. So predators must not die from extra-decomposers and extra-decomposers must live while they are performing their destination. Nothing must interrupt their existence earlier its time. We worried as if Junior had its eye on Beatrix as on a <span class="from_vocabulary">booty</span>. When we talked about this problem I did not remember the fact that Beatrix is poisonous. So we worried about Beatrix's live it not to be <span class="from_vocabulary">threatened</span> in connection with Junior. I do not know about dogs like your Junior if they <span class="from_vocabulary">internalize</span> bright colors as a poison sign or they do not. If they do not than we have to worry about Junior's life more than about Beatrix's life. I know predatory animals understand that such bright color means that the animal is poison and dangerous with the poison. But pet dogs are other thing.
