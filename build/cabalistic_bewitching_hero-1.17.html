        Yes. This is such specific woman. She is a devil and in the same time she is somebody like a human. It turned out that she had created all these extra-decomposers to <span class="from_vocabulary">upheld</span>  ballance in nature.

        It was very <span class="from_vocabulary">appealing</span>  theme for me in my previous life. As I have already told you and grandpa, I was not lucky to complete some <span class="from_vocabulary">inquiries</span>.

        Yes, I remember how much you told us. I was <span class="from_vocabulary">daunted</span>. It is not so airily as you, may be, think, Christian. I have already understood that you <span class="from_vocabulary">purport</span>  something what you <span class="from_vocabulary">purported</span>  in your previous life, but I can't understand something other.

    <p>
        I worry about you. I do it after you told us your storie about your scientific life. I am asked by myself such question: what if it is your <span class="from_vocabulary">redundant interference</span> in nature? I listened not very pleasant things from you. I remember you told about this strange picture with naked woman who had so <span class="from_vocabulary">stunning</span>  body! You told that you had seen it in your previous <span class="from_vocabulary">lamentable</span>  life. You were <span class="from_vocabulary">overhelmed</span>  that it was naked and so strange with tail like a lion tail and a big eye on the ass. You were <span class="from_vocabulary">tumulted</span>   in this time very much. I was <span class="from_vocabulary">commoted</span>  to know about this and about those case with a strange fear beast when you <span class="from_vocabulary">scarcely</span>   did not go mad. I think If I had been you this event would have been very <span class="from_vocabulary">instructive</span>   case for me. Besides this, seems to me, these extra-decomposers are not so frivolous. You said there are some different and poisonous insects among them. Don't you see something <span class="from_vocabulary">menacing</span>  in this?

    <p>
        Grandma, it is not just my <span class="from_vocabulary">whim</span>. It is my job and very serious job. Not only I engage it. There are many other scientists who also do it. We communicate between each-other regarding different questions about extra-decomposers. We have found out that the extradecomposers are not so dangerous as you presume.

You are under influence of your whimsy and <span class="from_vocabulary">insurmountable heat</span> to explore these strange live specie. It is very lamentable, Christian.

But my opinion is that your opinion which you have just said is <span class="from_vocabulary">fallacy</span>. You would understand the situation much more better if you were a scientist like me and worked in this scientific area. I can tell you very much about extra-decomposers.

I find it a real <span class="from_vocabulary">peril</span>. How do you know who are these extra-decomposers? Maybe they are really poisonous and <span class="from_vocabulary">perilous</span> beings.

It has been already proved that extra-decomposers are not so <span class="from_vocabulary">perilous</span> as you presume. I communicated with other scientists who <span class="from_vocabulary">notably</span> learn extra-decomposers and they told me much about this specie.

        Extra-decomposers are not whom are usual dangerous and poisonous animals and insects on our planet. Many of scientists told me about their <span class="from_vocabulary">inquiries</span>. They told about behaviour of extra-decomposers. These beings were very tranquil whatever the scientists did with them. These people did not try to torment these beings despite they put them in cages to learn their organism. Scientist do it through special apparatuses and don't experiment these beings in such way where there is a <span class="from_vocabulary">jeopardy</span> for life or health of these beings. I remember Beatrix warned that it is better for scientist not to do this with extra-decomposers, otherwise woman-devil can feel it and do something very unpleasant. So, we don't experience extra-decomposers in dangerous for their life way.,Have I <span class="from_vocabulary">propitiated</span> your feelings?

        Yes, she is, but I told you about her and different extra-decomposers. They are not whom <span class="from_vocabulary">ruthless</span> unconscious murderers are! Poison is given to extra-decomposers to protect themselves from predators who may be dangerous for their life. But it is not for poisoning people even scientist who may not to give them calm life.

        OK. We presume, you are absolutely right about your safety if we talk about extra-decomposers. But I am not calm regarding another question. I know you remember your past life well. I remember what you told me and your grandma. You told about this shocking creature whom you saw in your previous life. According to your words It was similar to a naked woman, but had what people don't have. I remember your narrative about this terrifying body: this eye on the one of halfs of the ass, this tail with brush on its end, horns, big clutches. I remember you told about this fascinating event! You went in a forest and suddenly stumbled upon so strange picture - a creature like a human, but naked with all these wonders! I remember you told with expressive intonation how <span class="from_vocabulary">overhelming</span> it was. Besides this I remember you told about a scary creature which you had seen in a forest. It was somebody like a big wild predatory beast and you run away spending all your forces. It was very <span class="from_vocabulary">breathtakingly</span>, and it was why you could not to continue science after that. You recognized that it, thank god, had not pursued you, but some time later.

        Now I guess who was the creature similar a naked woman. If I am right it means that this woman is not so horrific as you think. Moreover my <span class="from_vocabulary">acquaintances</span> know her. Beatrix lives with her in the ocean. Judy met and communicated with her. This woman was pleased after the meeting.

        Both of them. According to Beatrix's words this seemingly strange woman is who created all these extra-decomposers and she has created them with such purpose as to <span class="from_vocabulary">refine</span> nature from different <span class="from_vocabulary">redundant</span> yuck.

        But if something trouble happens with you, I guess, Beatrix will not be responsible for this. So we can to make her to report how it could be that she had assured you in safety of your job, but eventually there occured something unpleasant and unexpectable with you.

        I did not. I <span class="from_vocabulary">abdicated</span> Beatrix's suggestion to go with her, meet this woman and talk with her. I decided, that I don't need this as a scientist.

        I know this as a scientist. Many of scientists know meaning of existance of extra-decomposers. Scientists who learn them communicate to each-other, share knowledges between each-other. Beatrix told about this woman who has created extra-decomposers.  Judy met with her and told about her. This woman created extra-decomposers through her magic forces.

        I just said about this strange woman about whom you and grandpa worry. But I will not interfere in her life. It is just what I am not interested. But I have to know something what I have not known yet. It is related with features and life style of the extra-decomposers. So I am going to the place where I can do it.

        To be honest, I can say this thought only <span class="from_vocabulary">amplifies</span> my <span class="from_vocabulary">dissaray</span>however strange you can find it. Christian, I want to beleive that job of a scientist is a <span class="from_vocabulary">tangible threat</span> not in any area! By the way, Andy and you, Christian, too, have you ever had such thought in your mind: what if Christian, don't admit, god, is not satisfied by his attainments in this life like he was not in his previous life? So, will Christian have the idea to correct this like he has decided being born in this life? I mean, of course, will he have another one or maybe more attempts to be born in next life to do the trick in next life?

        Please, let me think during a few minutes after what I will have to say and go to the job not slowly. I must <span class="from_vocabulary">deliberate</span> your question <span class="from_vocabulary">piled</span> with the declarative sentences. Well, the implications is that you are concerned if I had hypothesis regarding the question: if Christian's badluck repeats again in this life will Christian have a possibility to rehabilitate with this being born again in the next life?

        Well, I did not have thoughts like this one. I hoped that Christian will be lucky in this life. Also I beleived that he is very clever and intelligent and capable to <span class="from_vocabulary">cope with</span> all the tasks <span class="from_vocabulary">arishing</span> in his serious and interesting job. Even when he told me and you about his engagement I did not have a thought that it may be dangerous. But I had one negative though when Christian had told us about this strange naked creature which was so <span class="from_vocabulary">dizzying</span>. I was surprised very negatively. I could not understand how it maybe possible. But I completely did not presume that Christian can collide with something very unpleasant and <span class="from_vocabulary">dizzying</span> in his current life. Maybe if I was on the Christian's place I could not make an attempt to rehibilitate like Christian because I have not so strong nerves as Christian has. But now I have concluded that Christian is very strong and self-confident. I have concluded it of the fact that his job seems to me is not the most tranquil one. Well, I have to go to my job. I wish Christian goodluck in his job in San Salvador. I would like you, Christian, to call me often when you will have left us.
