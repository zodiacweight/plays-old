        When Quentin was not at home there was something unusual in his living place. A company of 3 people invaded in his territory. These people thought that they would catch the human whom they needed and who was the mr Vincent Kidney's debtor. But it was <span class="from_vocabulary">fallacy</span>. These people were very wrong and this mistake was literally femme. They saw that there were nobody there and decided to wait. There was such situation when Quentin had returned at home, entered and <span class="from_vocabulary">absolutely</span> unexpectably seen 3 unfamiliar to him people. When Quentin had saw this he goggled.

    </p><strong>
        Quentin

    <p>
        I don't know about whom you are speaking. I am not familiar with any Sophie.

        But at this moment Quentin's patience was at the end. It had ended so quickly because Quentin was a natural wack and maniac. He jumped highly and his legs stretched forth and was <span class="from_vocabulary"> bumped</span> in the chests of 2 of these people. So these men was <span class="from_vocabulary">toppled</span> at the floor and their guns flew off from his hands. Just Quentin's legs had appeared on the floor Quentin instantly appeared on the floor with his whole body. At this moment the man№3 released a bullet from his gun, but it flew over Quentin. This man did not catch to react to Quentin's moving down and he shot at he place where Quentin's body had been before Quentin leaned. Just the man had shot Quentin caught his eggs under his crotch with all his force. The man cried and the gun was <span class="from_vocabulary">toppled</span> out from his hands. Quentin bit leg of the man with his force. The man cried was <span class="from_vocabulary">sharply</span>. Quentin saw through a bit of the leg of this <span class="from_vocabulary">ignoramus rabble</span> man and this man felt with load <span class="from_vocabulary">harsh</span> pain crying. Quentin lifted and bumped his fist in the eggs of the man.

        At this time man 1 who was <span class="from_vocabulary">daunted</span> and feared very much, run into a room, put off his underwear and wrote on the carpet. Man 1 was lifting from the floor and stretching his hand to his gun. Quentin rised on his legs and saw that this man was touching the gun. Quentin instantly run to the gan, hit hand of the <span class="from_vocabulary">ignoramus</span> man and the gun flew far from him. The man looked at his ill pained hand. Quentin instantly punched face of this man with his leg. Quentin did it with a large force. The man cried very loudly and <span class="from_vocabulary">sharply</span>. Quentin hit body of this man a few times more and after that he hastily turned to the other man while he had not risen and get his gun. Quentin pushed his face with his leg. After that Quentin took the guns and threw them that they flew very far. He had coped with these 2 goofy assholes very quickly. Anything what he needed and what he had - were his quickness and physical force. Quentin came in the room where the man 1 was. At this moment the ignoramus was positioned backwards to Quentin and buttoning his panties.

        Quentin was staying in front of the man for a short time perceiving what this idiot had done. It inspired Quenitin more. After that he went close to the man, grabbed him by the neck and lifted him over the floor. The man could say nothing in his feared mood status.
    </p><strong>
        Quentin
    </strong>
    <p>
        You, dirty fucking beast! I even don't know what to say! Maybe you will die not so soon as your friends! You will lick off what you have done!

        Quentin released the man and the man toppled on the floor. It was the following time when he was very pained. He cried from this pain very loudly.
    </p><strong>
        Quentin
    </strong>
    <p>
        I am not gonna to be <span class="from_vocabulary">affronted</span> by clearing your frigging pissing! I hope it is understandable for your goofy paltry <span class="from_vocabulary">frigging</span> mind! Now you are going to open your crappy mouth, stretch you tongue from it and lick your own shit off!

        The poor man felt that he had weakened completely from Quentin's forces and aggressiveness. He felt that he had nothing to do except subordination to Quentin's agressive <span class="from_vocabulary">decrees</span>. He was ready to do anything if only Quentin would not kill him or hurt more. So he began to lick his own pissing with his own tongue. Quentin was staying near him and looking at him. Some time later Quentin left the man and before doing this he said to him very hardly:
    </p><strong>
        Quentin
    </strong>
    <p>
        Stay here. No more movings than licking!
    </p><strong>

    <p>
        While Quentin was not near the man the man was licking off very weakly. Soon Quentin came and brought a bucket of water with cloth.
    </p><strong>
        Quentin
    </strong>
    <p>
        Take this and wash your pissing with this facilities. I don't think that licking with your <span class="from_vocabulary">reeking</span> tongue will have a result.

    <p>
        After you will have washed this you will wash blood of your comrados from my carpet in the corridor! I will take their bodies out from there and you will clear the carpet! You will be doing this until you will have cleared it ideally. Do you understand me?

        After this poor tormented man had done anything what Quentin had ordered him to do Quentin took his life, too. He decided that he would have felt himself unsatisfactorily if he had not killed everybody of these people who so suddenly invaded into his life. So he took the corpses out of his flat by one, brough them in his barn and burned them in there.,In reality the human with whom these idiots contacted is a natural wack and the best way is to <span class="from_vocabulary">retreat</span> from such people as far as it is possible. It is the only good way. So Quentin recognized that there was just a dirty <span class="from_vocabulary">ignoramus</span> tart who had a financial debt in front of somebody. Also there was the company of assholes who climbed to him instead of to touch this tart because of this debt. It turned out that Quentin had the same surname that this tart and her "muzhichok" had. So this abstract tart was blamed by Quentin for this unpleasant for him event. Quentin felt that he <span class="from_vocabulary">longed for</span> to find out how he could to reach natural debtor and to make a very "funny" adventures from him. His <span class="from_vocabulary">mettle</span> to rent this person brutally was just <span class="from_vocabulary">frenzied</span>.,And one day Quentin was in the house of people who were related with this financial debt. There was mr Stevenson and a dirty prostitute who was married with him. Mr Stevenson was an old and mentally retarded invalid. Quentin was in the room where this man was sitting behind his table. Quentin was staying in front of the table and tried to find out what he was concerned.

    <p>
        Yes, my Sophie, Sophie Stevenson is a debtor. And what do you want from me else?
    </p><strong>
        Quentin
    </strong>
    <p>
        I would like to understand something at least! It is not my debt! It is a debt of your crappy Sophie as you know. She is a debtor, not me and in the same time the carpet which was pissed was mine carpet. I accept a cheeful gladness for them with my carpet, I did anything as I was must to do, but it is not anything. I have to find out how it has happened.
    </p><strong>
        Nick
    </strong>
    <p>
        What are you talking about? I can understand not a word!
    </p><strong>
        Quentin

    <p>
        You completed asshole! Did I not tell you enough? You affect my nerves!
    </p><strong>
        Nick
    </strong>
    <p>
        What!? I affect your nerves!? How it can be not a shame from your side!? Don't you really see that I am an old invalid and in the same time you are a yong large health stezhina! And you say me such things!
    </p><strong>
        Quentin
    </strong>
    <p>
        You affect my nerves with your stupidness! Your crappy age doesn't play a role in this case except one obvious fact that your age has affected your mind <span class="from_vocabulary">tangibly</span>! And in the <span class="from_vocabulary">sequel</span> your completely <span class="from_vocabulary">foolish</span> mind  is getting on my nerves now!

    <p>
        You know, what? My Sophie is not very interesting for me. She is a usual dirty tart, not an intelligent talented person. There are many tarts like her in the world. But it has happened so that now I am married with her. There were unfovarable circumstances and so now we are married. But I don't think about Sophie as about a closed to me person. I don't like tramps like her. I would be glad to get rid of her and not to be married with her, but I worry about my estate. She can sue a big part of my estate if we divorce. So, now I am <span class="from_vocabulary">urged</span> to be married with her and to let her to live a good life in my house under my money. I am not interested in her debt very much. I can say only that she is not a usual prostitute, she films in pornographic movies and her debt is a debt in front of the producer of these movies. The producer could send people to pull duty out from a debtor. Now I hope you will outdone from me.

        Where is your Sophie?

        What!? Who are you at least!? I have seen a discourteous <span class="from_vocabulary"> ignoramus</span> cad! What I am <span class="from_vocabulary">induced</span> to tell you? Am I induced to you for your so called politeness?
    </p><strong>
        Quentin

    </p><strong>
        Quentin

    <p>
        I said it seriously, Stevenson. Really I can make you very painly! I can take away your piffling life!
    </p><strong>

        Quentin went to the table of mr Stevenson and pushed it. The table with mr Stevenson was <span class="from_vocabulary">toppled</span>. Mr Stevenson was laying helplessly and howling not very loudly.

        Quentin turned and went from the room. He searched the whole court of Stevensons and find a girl sitting in the chair in front of a garden.

        What is your name and what have you come for?
    </p><strong>
        Quentin

    <p>
        My name is Quentin. I have come to talk with you. I have already talked with your life satellite, but, alas, I have understood that he is a useless interlocutor. So I will talk with you. I heard you are a prostitute and you have a debt in front of the producer in whose movies you take part. I am <span class="from_vocabulary">coerced</span> to say you that I had a company of dunces in my flat a few days ago. They came to deal with the debt. It is definetely not my debt and it is not related with me, but I would <span class="from_vocabulary">prompted</span> to pay for it if I did not use my force. Now I have found out about the natural debtor who is you. I would like to find out how it is possible that I was must to be responsible for your debt while you are nobody for me.
    </p><strong>
        Sophie
    </strong>
    <p>
        I don't know what company of dunces you are talking about. Who are they?
    </p><strong>
        Quentin
    </strong>
    <p>
        I am not <span class="from_vocabulary">acquainted</span> with them. I don't know their names. But I know that your producer sent them to deal with your debt. They came in my flat and thought that I am <span class="from_vocabulary">obliged</span> to them. Maybe they thought that I am Stevenson who is married with you and so they climbed to me.
    </p><strong>
        Sophie
    </strong>
    <p>
        And what then? Sorry me, Quentin, but I can tell you about it nothing. I am just not responsible for behavior of these people. Are they a threat for you now?
    </p><strong>
        Quentin
    </strong>
    <p>
        No. I have <span class="from_vocabulary">coped with</span> this deal. But, of course, I am not gonna to pay for your debt.
    </p><strong>
        Sophie
    </strong>
    <p>
        How can I be helpful for you then? Maybe we will forget about this and enjoy life? I can such for you for $1000 if you want.

        It was not something <span class="from_vocabulary">ludicrous</span> for such dirty - as Sophie. But Quentin was <span class="from_vocabulary">incenced</span> very much. He felt himself <span class="from_vocabulary">affronted</span> to listen from an unfamiliar and, moreover so ugly babe so!
    </p><strong>
        Quentin
    </strong>
    <p>
        What!? You are a married woman! I am nobody for you! If you think it doesn't matter because your life satellite is old farter and so he has nothing for you to such and joy!? Were you <span class="from_vocabulary">enforce</span> to marry him? You may suck for your clients, but not for me! You are enough ugly babe and absolutely not a pretty sexy girl!

        In Quentins's world-vision to kill some people was <span class="from_vocabulary">interconvertible</span> to kill some <span class="from_vocabulary">frigging</span> annoying insects who would impede to live quitly. So Quentin went behind this babe,  took her on hair with one his hand and griped her mouth with his another hand. He dragged her from the chair by her head and brought to kill. Sophie could not to cry loudly because her mouth was griped.

        Quentin threw Sophie in a wall with <span class="from_vocabulary">exerting</span>. Bones of Sophie's back, hands and legs were broken. She could not make a little movement. Quentin brought an axe from a barn of Stevensons and chopped Sophie up with it. At least there was a sea of blood with Sophie's broken body. Quentin brought a <span class="from_vocabulary">dustbin</span> and began throw parts of heap of litter on the dry parts of Sophie's body and and burn them. So there almost nothing of Sophie's body and her blood was more similar to a shed dry paint than to a blood sea. After that Quentin found another one <span class="from_vocabulary">dustbin</span> with <span class="from_vocabulary">litter</span> which was bigger than the first one. Quentin rained out the <span class="from_vocabulary">litter</span> form this <span class="from_vocabulary">dustbin</span> on the remains of Sophie's body. So it became looking so that it was very difficult to guess that there was a dead body sometimes ago. Anything of this Quentin did accurately. It was not desirable to mr Stevenson knew that Quentin had killed Sophie. He does not know about it for now, but reekness from the place where Sophie had been killed and rained with <span class="from_vocabulary">litter</span> was horrible. Quentin did not sniff it long. He went from this place just he had rained the <span class="from_vocabulary">litter</span>.,For what mr Stevenson to kiss Quentin into ass was that Quentin did not kill him and helped him to get rid of the encumbrance Sophie. And, of course, Quentin saved life of mr Stevenson by not internalizing this. If Quentin had not killed Sophie the beast will catch to hair a killer to kill Nick and be gotten rid of him.,There were some good people, <span class="from_vocabulary">acquaintances</span> of Stevensons who came, moved the table from mr Stevenson and helped him to rise up.,The producer who was must to get these money from Sophie was <span class="from_vocabulary">detrimented</span> very much that he knew nothing about where were his money. One day he knew that Sophie was killed, also he knew that there was something wrong with her spose. So the producer knew nothing about his money which were Sophie's debt. Who could return them to him in this moment - it was completely misunderstandable. So the producer decided that he <span class="from_vocabulary">ignorantly</span> had escaped them and so he was stressed very much. He twitched in a fit and after that he could not eat and go to the toilet normally. His waste streamed from his genitals before he caught to reach his toilet. The producer was taken by ambulance and brought to the hospital where he was <span class="from_vocabulary">incited</span> to be in one medical cabinet. Doctors fed him intravenously and nurses cleared up floor, coach, berth and the walls of this cabinet from his waste.
