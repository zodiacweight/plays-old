            Yes, I agree, it is a nonsense. We can talk and talk about it. Let's discuss another thing now. I heard there was a new marine pet as a present for Helen.

        <p>
            Exactly. She is a cruise mermaid or a marine butterfly with a human body. The pet is very unusual. I have never had  such pets. She swims in water and flies in air like a butterfly. She <span class="from_vocabulary">sways</span> with her wings both in water and air and moves in this way. Her wings are like wings of a butterfly.

            Yes, she is very unusual. I have never had such pets too. But she does not have a tail like a tail of a mermaid. So we can not call her a natural mermaid.

            I have never seen such creatures earlier in my life and so I was <span class="from_vocabulary">overwhelmed</span> by meeting with such creature as Beatrix. It was most extraordinary and unusual to see such a creature. A chair <span class="from_vocabulary">shattered</span> under me from surprise.

        <p>
            I was <span class="from_vocabulary">overwhelmed</span> too, but still I did not go mad. Later I heard how this creature spoke human language! It was something amazing to such extent! It is a not quite human creature and completely unknown to us and though it can speak! It is a special innovation!
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Helen">

        <p>
            Yes, all of us were <span class="from_vocabulary">overwhelmed</span>. But Beatrix's suggestion that she was going to live in my aquarium did not caused any objections in me. Judy, Cassandra and me - we all were <span class="from_vocabulary">overwhelmed</span>, but somehow I liked Beatrix because she is such an unusual creature. Beatrix said you knew that I would like her and so you wanted her to live in my house.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Christian">

        <p>
            Here I can <span class="from_vocabulary">appease</span> and <span class="from_vocabulary"> mollify</span> you. My grandpa has carefully washed her in a clean water with soap and brush. Afterwards she has not been in a swamp any more. Right after washing  we brought her to you. During the trip she sit at grandpa's shoulder right before she came to you and Judy and Cassandra. Therefore, there is no reason to <span class="from_vocabulary">disdain</span> her so much. She did not immediately fly dirty from the swamp to you.

        <p>
            But when she climbed  the table, Helen was almost fail into a rage. She gave her a sharp command: go away. Beatrix responded to leap off the table into my lap. And my reaction to this leap was to <span class="from_vocabulary"> teeter</span> and to tremble! This reaction was provoked way of being, an unusual and unfamiliar to my perception. And, moreover, I had a feeling that this wonder has jumped on me. I was aware that it was out of the swamp. All these factors together have provoked my wild reaction to this creature touching me.

        <p>
            I agree with this. But I did not know that it was washed and disinfected. In my reaction I angrily casted her away, and now I regret about it.

        <p>
            I don’t know. When my grandpa has caught her, she already had the name. So, listen to an important message. I believe that keeping at home such creatures as Beatrix can be quite a problem for their survival. These creatures have primitive intellect with which they do not completely understand their danger. Beatrix can crawl from the aquarium not awaring the danger for her existence in such a moment when you are not near her. She would like to walk, fly and hunt insects. In that case she can became a <span class="from_vocabulary">booty</span> of your dog or some other dog.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Cassandra">
            Cassandra
        </strong>
        <p>
            Helen understands all this. She has talked with Beatrix about it. And she told her to stay in the aquarium when she is away.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Christian">
            Christian
        </strong>
        <p>
            Beatrix is such creature whose brain is more primitive than human brain. She is not so aware of danger as a clever human would be. That is why I think it is necessary to cover your aquarium so that Beatrix will not fly away without you noticing if you want her to be all right. It is the right idea to put something on the surface of your aquarium. But this idea has a bad side.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Helen">
            Helen
        </strong>
        <p>
            Cassandra  offered me her iron window lattice but I don’t like this idea. I reckoned that it will not work. Cells of this lattice, must be, big enough for Beatrix to come though and crawl through them. That is why we decided it will be better for Beatrix to stay away from the surface and crawl only when I will give her a signal that it is safe.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Christian">
            Christian
        </strong>
        <p>
            But I still think you should not renounce <span class="from_vocabulary">abdicate (abandon?)</span> from the idea to cover the surface of the marine hole. Given the fact that the mind of such a creature like Beatrix, walling up the aquarium may seem to reassure you to do anything else. Of course, it must be something that contains holes in itself but not big enough so that the inhabitants of the aquarium couldn’t get out. But on other hand Beatrix needs to hunt insects and she will have to get out from the aquarium and <span class="from_vocabulary">soar</span> over the vegetable garden to do this. But to leave Beatrix without keeping an eye on her when she is away from  the marine aquarium is dangerous for her life. Will you follow her every time when she flies out of her habitats?
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Helen">

        <p>
            That is the inconvenience of keeping creatures of  such species in the house. If you are sure Beatrix won’t fly from the aquarium at a random moment it is your fault. You must understand her desire to look at the world around her out of this little habitat. Therefore you must <span class="from_vocabulary">deliberately</span> create <span class="from_vocabulary">hurdles</span> so that  her desire cannot be realized at any moment.

            How can you allow your dog to drink from the aquarium populated with living creatures? It seems to me you <span class="from_vocabulary">derail</span> the fates of your marine pets and ignore them.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Helen">

        <p>
            I disagree with this. I know Junior is smart enough to understand that these are living creatures and my pets. Besides I can say he drinks from the aquarium rather rarely and only during the warm season. Often he drinks from his drinker. There can be different water level in the aquarium. I can pour such a low level that Junior won’t reach the surfac.

            But since you keep Beatrix you need to take aquarium security more carefully in connection with what I have already explained you about your new pet.

            I have answered you about the rest of my pets. I will make the level of water so low that Junior will not reach the surface and I will train him to drink from his drinker. Sometimes I feel it before I go somewhere so that Junior will not run away from the yard.

            All my acquaintances tie their dogs sometimes when they think it is important. I have some important arguments to <span class="from_vocabulary">compel</span> Junior to <span class="from_vocabulary">abdicate</span> freedom of movement and chose another place for recreation instead of the booth. Do you know why?

        <p>
            Often it happened that when I am not home he runs away somewhere from the yard for a walk. In some lucky cases Junior comes back home not too late. But when I am not lucky he has spent dead of night, scratches and barks at the gate. I have to <span class="from_vocabulary">abdicate</span> from slow recreation and go to meet Junior.

            Unfortunately it happens so. I open the gate for him, he enters and I tell him: “Have you spent? It is curious what did you look for during this long period. Do you go to reproduce or look for some other dogs with whom to chat or flirt? But whatever you engaged in I want think about the interests of your hosts. If you go away somewhere you must be back before 10 o’clock. If you don’t follow the rules you will <span class="from_vocabulary">solicit</span> restrictions of your freedom”.

            Do you see? You got the argument to admit that your dog does not understand or at least does not always understand human statements regarding what is allowed to him and what is not. We can have close conversation regarding your marine pets. We can conclude that hope that Junior would understand that he has to avoid touching them is naive. It will be safer if they will stay out of his reach.

            But I noticed Junior is clever when there is a case with the marine population. He has never eaten even small pets.

            It is appropriate to keep away  from the surface of the marine zone. But it is not <span class="from_vocabulary">nuff said</span> for Beatrix. It refers to your other marine pets. And I still think it will be sanely if you listen to Christian and do not stick to your own opinion. It is <span class="from_vocabulary">akin</span> Christian is smarter than your Junior.

            Have you something else to advise me as a cover to the aquarium?

            No, I don’t  unfortunately.

            I can give you a net. It is a piece of an old fence which stayed in the yard of my ancestors. And I think it will be better if we are going to me right now and give this part of the fence and later we go to you and secure Beatrix's life and later all together gather here again and continue the conversation. I engage <span class="from_vocabulary">inquiries</span> in the wildlife area and can tell you about the species to which Beatrix belongs.

            But at first we will go to you and wall up your hollow. It is unacceptable to <span class="from_vocabulary">postpone</span> such a task.  As soon as we do we will have a greater chance to protect Beatrix.

            During the trip I am going to tell you what you will have to feed to Beatrix. The feed that you give to your fishes is not her food.

            Christian, you yourself are innovation and besides, the fact that you discover such creatures as Beatrix, it is amazing!
