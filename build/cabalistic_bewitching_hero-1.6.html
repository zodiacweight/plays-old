            Helen has woken up in the middle of the night. She is laying on her bed and suddenly she is noticing that Beatrix is flying in the room with her glowing wigs. The wigs are lighting Beatrix's body.

            You were wrong. Did you outright quite? You said there is danger from your relentless dog and so I had not to be out from the aquarium when you did not oversaw me. I was laying circa the tree for sometime. You tolerated me to be out of the tank for this time!

            Is this something wrong with living here? When I <span class="from_vocabulary">deflate</span> water from the tank I carry about my pets for nobody being suffered. I regularly change water in the tank and feed you according to Christian's instructions about food you need. What do not you like in your life?

            It may be <span class="from_vocabulary">jarring</span> for you to hear it from me, but I must admit it is not perfect. I am going to explain why it is so. It is because the space in the aquarium is confined comparing with the space in the ocean and the swamp. Another disadvantage is that my best friend has been leaving in the swamp. But there are some advantages regarding living in your aquarium. While I was living among animals in nature I obtained <span class="from_vocabulary">livelihoods</span> for myself. Here I donâ€™t have to care about it.

            You <span class="from_vocabulary">conjured</span> me to stay away from your <span class="from_vocabulary">ruthless</span> dog when you do not oversaw me. I have understood you insist me to be always in the aquarium and never out. You permit me to be out of the tank only when you are near me and I am in safety with you. I am not sure I can find the way from here to the swamp. It is not so little distance. I do not precisely remember how I flew from the swamp to the ocean. I talked with passers, they told me how to reach the ocean. The way was long and not easy. Marine animals conducted me from the ocean to the river which enters into the ocean. <span class="from_vocabulary">Somehow</span> the way is long and the trip would be long and it must be not easy.

            I can care about your safety when you are out of the aquarium.  There are some moments when Junior is in its <span class="from_vocabulary">shack</span>. We can find the way from here to the swamp. I can by or ask somebody to give me a map about our terrain as a favor. There are <span class="from_vocabulary">negotiable</span> maps about land space. When we will have found out the ways we will go where we will need to go. We will go to the swamp by some transport.

            What press me it is such disparity: I had good friends in the swamp, but I wanted to see the world and so I had to leave the swamp and go to the ocean. It costed me friendship. Besides I must live in nature according to my live purpose.

            I went to you only for some time to see hydrosphere in the aquarium. Now I must tell you something important. I am such being whose mission is to save nature from the global pollution. According to the assignment beings of our species wipe nature litter such as carrion out. So we have place in nature where there is excess of carrion. I have features regarding my human form and nous and because of it sometimes I can be out of my real place in nature.

            Then I have something to tell you about an ocean. You must know it is not so safely in there. I would not recommend you to live in the ocean <span class="from_vocabulary">albeit</span> I have representation how wonderful it is there. But it is dangerous to live in the ocean and you are in safety in the aquarium. There are a lot of not less <span class="from_vocabulary">ruthless</span> animals than Junior in the ocean. They are predatory animals. Junior is a clever dog according to how I presume who understands that you are my alive pet and not his booty. Besides he always has what to eat in his bowl. There are no implications such these for predatory animals. They <span class="from_vocabulary">relentlessly assault</span> on other animals. You would better to <span class="from_vocabulary">retreat</span> from it. I would like you to live in my aquarium and us to go to the swamp  sometimes where you would meet your friend according to your desire.

            Beings of our species are poisonous and a threat for the predatory animals not less than the predatory animals for us. If a predatory animal eats somebody of us it will cost its live. Sorry, I did not tell you earlier that I am poisonous. I did not think that people do not like poisonous beings. But I am not dangerous for you and pets in your aquarium. I can poison water space only if there is some danger for me.

            I communicated with scientists who learn our species and they told there are different predatory animals. Some of them understand the threat and some do not understand. At least I will try keep away from them as far as it will be possible if I live in the ocean. In the last resort I will defeat myself from them poisoning the water space which will be location of mine and a predator. Somehow there is my mission not only in the swamp and so it can have place in the ocean. Now I want us to discuss our trip to the swamp. I am not planning my emigration to the ocean for now.

            May I ask you why you have covered the aquarium? I understand you about danger from your dog.

            Today I had such thought maybe Junior would bark <span class="from_vocabulary">hectically</span> if it saw you. Dogs like to bark at unfamiliar people and some pets like cats and dogs. <span class="from_vocabulary">Albeit</span> you are not a human, cat or dog, you are unfamiliar and <span class="from_vocabulary">conspicuous</span> live object for Junior and it would be a good reason for Junior to bark at you. I am not sure if it would have to hunt at you or not. <span class="from_vocabulary">Somehow</span>, I think it will be better for you and it not to see each-other. Now lets get into the aquarium again. I will <span class="from_vocabulary">oversaw</span> you while you will be returning into water.
