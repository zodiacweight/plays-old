        Ramon woked up. He had understood that he was being in water. So he felt something very strange and unbelieveable. It was the fact that Ramon breathed water. He has never done and could do it before in his life. How did he do it in this time he did not understand. Soon he noticed that there is something like big drifts swimming out from his back and when he had <span class="from_vocabulary">swayed</span> with bottom part of his body he saw something like a tail of a mermaid instead of the bottom half of his body which he had ever had. Ramon was feared. He remembered that he had fallen in the aquarium, but he could understand nothing of what could happen at the time when he had woken up. Soon he had seen somebody like mermaid and with big transparent wigs swimming towards to him from the front side. This mermaid was like a Barbie: long white queue of blonde hair, big roll blue eyes and gentle pink lips. The mermaid has big green <span class="from_vocabulary">transpicuous</span>  wigs like Ramon's ones. She was swimming moving her hands, tail and wigs. So Ramon was terribled more to see himself in water not like he had accustomed to see himself and this strange creature in front of him. He shook. Mermaid swam closer to him. After that she began getting up and Ramon had felt that he was getting up despite nobody and nothing was not touching him. Just Ramon and the mermaid emerged from the water and flew over it the mermaid began speaking not loudly.

        After these words the mermaid and Ramon flew behind a wall of the place where they got down. At this moment Ramon's bottom half of body was turned into what it has always been before this surprising event. The mermaid was turned in a female human. Here Ramon began speaking not very loudly, but nerviously.

        At this moment Ramon had gotten one moment of his life in his memory. It was how he had once upon a time seen a picture with likeness very similar to the likeness of this hero who was near him at this surprising moment of his life. Ramon recognized the likeness of the famous, but <span class="from_vocabulary">suspiciously</span> existing hero of the city. So his mood was <span class="from_vocabulary">ameliorated</span>. Ramon was inspired to see this hero and know that exactly this hero is whom was right in front of him in this strange and <span class="from_vocabulary">obscuring</span> episode of Ramon's life.

        The hero turned and left Ramon along. She went behind bushes in front of the gate. The hero listened steps from the front side. She has a <span class="from_vocabulary">guesswork</span> that it was something related to the evil. The hero saw a man oppening the gate and entering in the court. The man held an axe and a big knife in a cover attached to his belt. The man passed closer to the bushes behind which the hero was sitting and looking at him through the leaves. So he saw that his friends were laying on the floor. It was not understandable whether they were alive or dead. He was dumbfounded from this view. He did not expect to see them laying motionlessly. He had been looking at his friends for not a long time before the hero jumped up from the bushes and appeared in front of him. So the man <span class="from_vocabulary">sharply</span> switched the direction of his looking at her.

        The killer thought this was somebody crazy with whom he talked. He did not guess this was a natural superhero who can <span class="from_vocabulary">cope with</span> any murderer though Beatrix <span class="from_vocabulary">uttered</span> her words very confidently and he saw that there was something very unpleasant regarding his friends and apparently they were <span class="from_vocabulary">mangled</span>by this girl. The man saw nobody in good form except himself and this girl. The man and the girl run towards each other. The man stopped near the girl and swung with his axe at her <span class="from_vocabulary">efforting</span> all his forces, but at this moment the girl had caught his hands and pinched it firmly. She hit the arm of the man with her leg. Right after this moment she hit his lips with her leg. The heroe's <span class="from_vocabulary">foe</span> fell on the ground with <span class="from_vocabulary">mangled rutted</span> mouse and hand and the axe fell off from his hand on the ground near him. The girl got down her leg, leand with squatting, took the axe, straightened and threw the axe off far. Meanwhile the man touched his <span class="from_vocabulary">rutted</span> by the hit mouse. The girl stepped off from him and the man wiped blood from his face and got up from the land. Just he had done it the girl looked at him. He tooked the knife from his belt and swung at the girl with it. The girl caught his hand and right after that hit his nose and lips with the fist of her other hand. The man howled from pain. Then the girl hit him with her fist the second time in a 2 seconds so he did not caught even to think how to escape his hand off from her hand or hit her. The man howled louder from the second hit. At least the girl hit his lips the third time and he <span class="from_vocabulary">toppled</span> on the ground with properly <span class="from_vocabulary">rutted</span> nose and bleeded bottom half of face and dropped his knife. The knife fell near his legs. The girl came to him from the side of his head and pushed her leg on his neck. He tried to move her leg from his neck, but he was not successfull. So he was put in a hard state.,Hero put her leg off of the neck of this criminal and went to Ramon. After that this hero returned to Ramon's look.

One moment they unexpectable became behaviour strange and glaringly. I was really negatively surprised. I did not guess that they were maniacs, but it was a real noncense. They gave me advice to stick artificial hair on my <span class="from_vocabulary">bald</span> with the purpose to look better.

        They are alive, but they are wounded and immobilized by hits of pieces of ice. I lived in the water pool of these people and conducted surveillance over them. So I knew about them enough. They are employable killers who were going to make you their current victim. At once you had been threwn in the pool I saw you and freeze its surface into thick ice layer.

        Part of the frozen surface was covered with an iron sheet. Anything of this was made through my magic power. I saw through the ice layer anything near the pool including all these people. The tv-box was casted onto the iron sheet. After that I turned you into a merman. One man took a shovel and tried to break the ice. One of little pieces <span class="from_vocabulary">bumped</span> in his face and fell him. Soon other one of the maniacs brought a burning piece of a tree and began heating ice with it. A piece of ice was cut off from the ice surface after there had been a big <span class="from_vocabulary">fracture</span> around it. This piece <span class="from_vocabulary">soared</span> up with the iron sheet and the tv-box flew and <span class="from_vocabulary">bumped</span> in the face of th man who threw the tv-box. Immediately thereafter the iron sheet knocked other 2 of the people.

        Seems to me I can give you a superhero title. I hope you will not <span class="from_vocabulary">confront</span>. I would like to give you such title as X-lady or X-babe similar to secret lady or secret babe. What will you say?

        I think lady is more <span class="from_vocabulary">opportune</span> than babe from you.

        Ok. I will call you X-lady. I hope you like this title.

        But it is very possible that somebody of other people will want to give me some other nickname by their idea or somebody already have coined a nickname for me. Who else except you can know about my nickname X-lady if my meeting with you must be occult information?

    <strong data-person="Ramon">

    <p>
        I will call you X-lady. You will be titled like this for me at all. Well, what may I talk to you about? Is there something what may be without prejudice to your mysteries and what I can be interested in?

        We have stopped on the <span class="from_vocabulary">contemplation</span> the surprising situation occured today with you. We want to find out the reason why these people tried to kill you.

        I can also remind you that we have the subject - Molly. At the first we must find out if she knows who are these people or not. At the second why she decided to arrange your acquaintance and meeting with these people and why she has become acquainted with them at all. So I will live in your acquarium and oversee her like these people.

        But you will not fit in our acquarium. It is not so big as those one where you and me met. Can you change your size?

        Beatrix moved out from the car, came in it in front and sat on the front seat <span class="from_vocabulary">circa</span> Ramon. At this moment Beatrix and Ramon began whispering.

        You will ask Molly some questions and get answers. I will overhear and spy, watch her gestures and pay attention on them and her mood and intonation. So I have a possibility to find out her ideas and see true and false in her answers to interesting for us questions. Later I will profess to constitute all the facts and data in one - the whole storie about how this <span class="from_vocabulary">assult</span> has occured.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yeah, anything of it is so interesting and curious! To say more - bewitching! I feel I will be in this excited mood for a long time. But in the same time I would not like to <span class="from_vocabulary">repose</span> before I will be at home. I just don't know what shall I do. I can't take control over myself.

        It looked like Ramon immersed deeply in his thoughts. But he was keeping silence not too long before he began speaking again.

        No, I am not sure I can take control on myself. Can you think about your terrific magic power and suggest an idea what to do if we don't using management the vehicle for moving?

        Yeah, of course. I am a telekinesis. I can lift your car up with you without touching it and <span class="from_vocabulary">enforce</span> it to fly where you want.

        Beatrix stepped out from the car and closed the door behind herself. Ramon clutched to his helm strongly. Staying near the automobile Beatrix looked at it. The vehicle was <span class="from_vocabulary">lifted up</span> very quickly. It was continuing higher and higher slowly. Ramon felt his mood was excited more. He openned his mouth and did not know what to say emotionally at this time. Soon there appeared big brilliant wigs on Beatrix's back and Beatrix lifted up <span class="from_vocabulary">swaying</span> her wigs. Soon she caught the automobile in the high. There was a crowd of people formed near around the place from which Beatrix and Ramon in his car flew up. Mostly there were yong people, but all the people in the crowd were <span class="from_vocabulary">startled</span> to see this wonder. They had not accustomed to this phenomena as to something usually real by those moment. Many of them were staying freezing near the road.Ramon presented the hero the road and the <span class="from_vocabulary">sensational</span> hero led the car with him according to the instruction.

        Ramon enjoyed flying in his car in the magic forces of the interesting <span class="from_vocabulary">startling</span> hero. Beatrix smiled seeing that he felt joying in this process. Ramon got the thought that it must be true that to be a magic superhero is much cooler that to have a pretty splendid car.
