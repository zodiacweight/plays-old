            Frankly, I was really interested in some games such as chess, cards, tennis, billiards and something like that which may be a board or a sport game with a ball. But I have concerned unusual heroes for a long time not less than games with my friends. And now I have known that science may be related to the secrets of such bewitching heroes like you! So I can feel that there is something mysteriously interesting in the science where it is related with your mysteries.

But, at first you must ask her how much time she has been acquainted with them. Besides you may ask her about her communication with them as much as it is possible to know.

            In substance, Molly must not be at home now. But sometimes there are very unpredictable circumstances. As I know she is in her job now, but sometimes she returned home earlier than I thought. The reasons were her unpleasant health. I was at home playing with my friends at such moments and unexpectably I met her. It will be very unpleasant if she is at home now, but it is not excluded.

            I have some ideas regarding to this strange <span class="from_vocabulary">aforementioned</span> event. The ideas are about these people and their intention to put end of my life. It is not suprpising that they are killers. It was like they <span class="from_vocabulary"></span>professed to <span class="from_vocabulary"></span>affront me and <span class="from_vocabulary"></span>foster resentment in my mood. They asked me questions about Molly's wealth. I perceived these questions not as <span class="from_vocabulary"></span>pertinent questions. So now I suspect they <span class="from_vocabulary"></span>pretended to <span class="from_vocabulary"></span>plunder us and that's why they intended to kill me. So I was <span class="from_vocabulary">incensed</span>. The <span class="from_vocabulary">sequel</span> was not very happy. There appeared a fight between us. In <span class="from_vocabulary">outcome</span> I fell in those <span class="from_vocabulary">immense</span> acquarium where I could awash if there were not you. I was pushed there by one of these assholes. So they wanted to kill me. The main thought is that they <span class="from_vocabulary">incited</span> me to be <span class="from_vocabulary">incensed</span>, because they needed some motive to push me in water. So now it is not so surprising that they are salaried murderers.

            You are <span class="from_vocabulary">completely</span> right. But I must confess we can't know much more until we'll wait for Molly's coming and you'll talk to her. So I think I may repeat the answer to your question which was what you will must ask Molly about. You must ask why she has decided to <span class="from_vocabulary">impose</span> you exactly these people and if she knows that they are murderers or not. I will look at her reaction and gestures when you ask her these questions and she answers them.
