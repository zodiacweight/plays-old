        Helen, Judy and Cassandra come to the Helen's home from their walking. Helen decides to take the shower Judy at the first turn as one of her guests. Judy has gone to the shower. Helen and Cassandra is noticing that Beatrix is <span class="from_vocabulary">attending </span> in the aquarium. They are glad to see her. Beatrix is <span class="from_vocabulary">soaring </span>in water. Helen and Cassandra are climbing up to a <span class="from_vocabulary">ladder. </span> They are reaching the second floor and come to the room where the hole to the water space is. Helen and Cassandra see that Beatrix is hanging over the hole <span class="from_vocabulary">jarring </span> her wigs.

        Hi, girls! Hi, Helen! Nice to meet both of you! I remember you very well. You, Helen, got the letter from me and I hope now is suitable time for us to speak.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">

    <p>
        Hi, dear! But why your tail is looking like a natural tail?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix
    </strong>
    <p>
        Because I am in my other <span class="from_vocabulary">epitome </span> now. The devil-woman has reincarnated me into this <span class="from_vocabulary">epitome</span> of a creature with tail like a tail of a mermaid instead of legs.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        It is curious and <span class="from_vocabulary">astounding</span>. I would like to know who is she at all.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix

    <p>
        Iâ€™ll tell you, of course. But I am a question to you, too. I remember you have a dog named Junior. Is he far now?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">

    <p>
        Junior is in his booth now.

    <strong data-person="Beatrix">

    <p>
        I remember you <span class="from_vocabulary">conjured</span> me not to fall on his eyes.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">

    <p>
        Junior is sleeping locked in his booth. You may hang in air. Where have you learnt to write?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix
    </strong>
    <p>
        I cannot write. The devil creature wrote the letter according to what I wanted write you. I caught a moment when a host was not at home and flew into one of his rooms through the window where I give writing instruments and brought them to the devil creature.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">
        Cassandra

    <p>
        Can you tell us about the devil creature?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">

    <p>
        Of course, I can.

    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yes. Exactly. We would like to know very much about this devil creature. I remember you wrote that the human who is a host of the court with this lake knows about the creature nothing. This proposition <span class="from_vocabulary">compels </span> to take thought how does it refer to people. Besides we have some other questions related with the devil creature which are <span class="from_vocabulary">opportune </span> as we think. At first, we are concerned if you have some <span class="from_vocabulary">testimony</span> to represent it to us right now that we will not get in <span class="from_vocabulary">cul-de-sac</span> when we meet it.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix
    </strong>
    <p>
        I did not want bring you <span class="from_vocabulary">turmoil</span> feelings. I really feel myself a bit <span class="from_vocabulary">fumble</span> by looking at Cassandra's <span class="from_vocabulary">frenetic</span> view. I do not <span class="from_vocabulary">compel</span> you and Christian to go. Believe me, if you are people it is enough <span class="from_vocabulary">pertinent</span> for you to communicate with such devil creature as this.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">
        Cassandra
    </strong>
    <p>
        Can you tell us about the devil without any <span class="from_vocabulary">superfluous</span> words? How do you know that it is responsible for appearance of extra-decomposers in our world?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix
    </strong>
    <p>
        There is one devil-woman in human views. She lives in the lake where I live now. She does not feel neither <span class="from_vocabulary">loathing</span> nor <span class="from_vocabulary">contempt</span> to people despite she is a devil. She has created these extra-decomposers like me.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        Does she refer to such people as scientists not fairly?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix
    </strong>
    <p>
        She does not refer to scientists with <span class="from_vocabulary">loathing</span> or <span class="from_vocabulary">disdain</span>, she refers to them neutrally, but she must not know that Christian wants to talk with her as a scientist with such purpose as to develop his knowledges in extra-decomposers area. She would not like to <span class="from_vocabulary">foster</span> to the scientists. Another case is talking with a human as a simple guest.

        Beatrix

    <p>
        Judy, I lived not in the swamp last time. I lived in a lake. So there are no good reasons to squeamish me. It was such clean hydrosphere as in the Helen's aquarium.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">

        There are such marine inhabitants in the lake where lived Beatrix the last time which do not differ from inhabitants in my aquarium.

    <p>
        At least it is very <span class="from_vocabulary">staggering</span> that we, people, will communicate with the Devil. I worry about such question: maybe there is something <span class="from_vocabulary">unfathomable</span> for a human mind regarding these extra-decomposers?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">

        It may be that these devil creatures can <span class="from_vocabulary">turn out</span> something <span class="from_vocabulary">maddening</span> for a human.

    <strong data-person="Helen">

        How has she create you if you were born in human <span class="from_vocabulary">epitome</span> earlier and after that was turned into an extra-decomposer?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix

    <p>
        I do not see <span class="from_vocabulary">discrepancy</span> in my words. I was a human earlier. You are right. But I had died being a human and after that the woman-devil created the extra-decomposer body and I was reincarnated in it. The woman-devil has made it.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">
        Judy

    <p>
        Can you tell us about this woman-devil and more concrete how she refers to the extra-decomposers?

    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix
    </strong>
    <p>
        What is related with the appearance of extra-decomposers I know only that she has created the extra-decomposers with her mysterious forces. I can tell how she looks if you want.

        She is like a human in general. She has body like a human body. But she also has some differences from a human. For example, she has a tail like a lion tail, horns, clutches. Also she has 3 eyes unlike a human. She <span class="from_vocabulary">wields</span> unbelieveable devil force. She has created extra-decomposers according to her own initiative seeing that there is real carrion excess in nature.

        Now I am going to <span class="from_vocabulary">imbue</span> into the lake. You will have to fly by swans. You can not <span class="from_vocabulary">afford</span> to go through the court of the host. I will fly for the swans and negotiation with it. After that there will be a moment when the swans will can take you to the lake.

    <p>
        We will discuss the questions when there will be suitable moment for everybody of you to fly. Let me tell you a story of my life. It is about important events which occurred with me after I had left Helen. I was caught by a human who brought me to a sale. I was sold in a marine pets shop. I was <span class="from_vocabulary">unwittingly impelled</span> to be sold and so <span class="from_vocabulary">unwittingly</span> I was <span class="from_vocabulary">impelled</span> to be bought by one family. A little girl covered the surface of their aquarium with a <span class="from_vocabulary">lid</span> with the purpose to <span class="from_vocabulary">hinder</span> my redemption from her. When she took me from the aquarium I was <span class="from_vocabulary">impelled</span> to serve the girl as a toy. She played with her toys and me as a living toy. I was a <span class="from_vocabulary">striking</span> toy for her. She gave me a name. I said I already had a name, but it did not bother her. Sometimes these games were just <span class="from_vocabulary">untenable</span> for me! Mummy of this girl stitched dresses, blouses, skirts and <span class="from_vocabulary">slippers</span> for me. The family saw that I did not like live in their aquarium. They wanted take me with themselves to the beach, but afraid that I would run away from them. I remember one time they caged me into a bird cage and strapped the cage to a ball with a rope. They went to a beach with me <span class="from_vocabulary">confined</span> into these implements. Sometimes it looked like I was an <span class="from_vocabulary">inalienable</span> part of life of these children when they had begun take me with themselves to the beach. I had such dream thought that the children would grew up and toys will be <span class="from_vocabulary">repealed</span> and may be my freedom would be <span class="from_vocabulary">resumed</span>. But there had been one coup of events in result of which I had breached to the will earlier than the children would grow up.

    <p>
        Of course, this life seemed <span class="from_vocabulary">preposterous</span> and meaningless to me. You are completely right. I am in this world with completely other purpose. But there were such circumstances where I pleased by the arm of these kids and become a hostage. They had enough powers to be my <span class="from_vocabulary">overlords</span>.

        I am agree <span class="from_vocabulary">altogether</span> with you. But people like money very much. The bigger gain is the more satisfied people are. So they caught and took me to the shop of those considerations that I can bring them success as demanded merchandise.

    <strong data-person="Beatrix">

    <p>
        I ate what the children gave me. In the beginning it was such food as fish feed. But some time later the children noticed that I could not eat it. It fell out from me. Soon I got illness. The family <span class="from_vocabulary">summoned</span> a veterinary. Not the first veterinary could explain them what happened with me. I had <span class="from_vocabulary">guessworks</span> regarding my illness, but nobody of the members of the family believed me. The <span class="from_vocabulary">guessworks</span> were that the reason of the illness was that I had eaten not my food. The veterinary said the same and also he said that he could give the family some medical prescriptions to help me. They <span class="from_vocabulary">spurned</span> this idea because they had decided that it would be too inconvenient for them. So they threw me out. Before that I asked the veterinarian if that was possible to me carry about myself without help. The veterinary said that there was necessity to write a long medical prescription. Because of I could not write I had to carry about myself. I had lived in nature without help for some time being ill while the woman-devil took me under her <span class="from_vocabulary">oversaw</span>. She was very useful <span class="from_vocabulary">custodian</span> for me. Maybe she is <span class="from_vocabulary">omnipotence</span> and the fact is that she has helped me to recover. I was very thankful to her. But now I don't like my life in the lake with her. She is my <span class="from_vocabulary">overlord</span>. Now I have a <span class="from_vocabulary">grander undertaking</span> before the woman-devil to serve her and I can not dare to <span class="from_vocabulary">rebuff</span> from my <span class="from_vocabulary">responsibility</span> before her.

        You could not write and there was necessity to write very much. These 2 facts were the reason why you could not solve the question about your recovery independently. I think your hosts could write. If it is true then I have such question: could they take to themselves writing and in the same time you take to yourself the cure?

        These people had to go they did not know where to <span class="from_vocabulary">mine</span> some medical facilities. We did not know where is a forest with such plants. Besides I needed carrion. They did not want cook me feed of carrion. It was <span class="from_vocabulary">abhorrent</span> for them. Besides they thought that to let me fly <span class="from_vocabulary">outwards</span> of their living space and to reckon that I would continue life in their aquarium are <span class="from_vocabulary">irreconcilable</span> in the same time. They thought that if they had released me I would have run away from them. So they decided to let me fly to freedom.

        I think we have told about your past enough. I want us change the theme a little if you do not <span class="from_vocabulary">take offense</span> and are agree that we have told about this your story enough. There are some other questions which not just interest us and <span class="from_vocabulary">conjure obscurity</span> in our mind. I would like us to discuss them.

        Thank you, Helen, but it was not enough to tire. I move to large distances for long time periods and tire a little with that.

        We must thoroughly think do we have to go or we do not. It is about Christian, too.
