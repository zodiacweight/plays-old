            I would not like kid with you. But the trust is that you will must speak with one devil creature if you acceptthe offer. This devil has created extra-decomposers and can tell you very much about their  Beatrix <span class="from_vocabulary"> posits </span> that it is not somebody <span class="from_vocabulary"> unrelenting </span>to humans.

            It is just preconceptions. This woman is not evil for us. She is very good-looking and friendly person. She helped me to recover after my illness which I had gotten <span class="from_vocabulary">afterward</span> of one unpleasant story occured in my life. Nobody would help me except her. I am so thankful to her!

            Yes, when I was free it was better. Now I live in the lake with her and there I am <span class="from_vocabulary">urged</span> to serve her. But I am very thankful to the woman-devil now. Maybe I would not live now if she was not in my life. I feel I owe her despite it <span class="from_vocabulary">incites</span> me to <span class="from_vocabulary">rack my brains</span>.

            Beatrix

        <p>
            I have many responsibilities of her. I have role of a maidservant, nurse and toy for little <span class="from_vocabulary">hatched</span> cubs of marine inhabitants. Those cubs are not her descendants, but she is a ringleader of this underwater world. She can assign me such roles which she thinks I must <span class="from_vocabulary">comply</span>. So I help her to arrange her places and <span class="from_vocabulary">refuges</span> under water which she uses with different purposes. I am used as a nurse for cubs of little animals and as a toy for cubs of big animals such as cats. They play with me like cats with cordage what I don't like very much.

            After my life in Helen's aquarium I was caught by one man who brought me to a shop where I was bought by one family. I lived in their aqarium. They did not feed me how they were must and as <span class="from_vocabulary">consequences</span> I got illness. People decided that it would be too difficult to them to treat me and they throw me out. Later this woman-devil found and cured me near a river. After that she brought me to this court and I started to live with her.

            I have already tried to explain that the woman-devil is not <span class="from_vocabulary">grim</span> for you despite you associate devils with evil. I have no idea how to convince you in other way. More by token the woman-devil must not know that you are a scientist and you want to talk with her in such purposes as bring something new in your learning extra-decomposers. Besides the hosts of the estate who know nothing about wonders in this underwater world must know nothing about your visit in this lake. You will have to <span class="from_vocabulary">mine</span> a diving suit, penetrate into the lake and talk with the woman-devil in there. You can use a big, strong and clever swan to fly over the fence to the lake. After that you can dive into water and meet the woman-devil.

            Thank you very much for your proposal, but I want you understand me. You are just one of the specific wonderful creatures in nature. I am a professional scientist. I know about science and job of a scientist <span class="from_vocabulary">tangibly </span> more than you. I know what ideas I must admit and what ideas I must not. Please, don't <span class="from_vocabulary">take offense</span> at me. I do not need information about <span class="from_vocabulary">provenance</span> of extra-decomposers if it is based on magic. Learning their anatomy, lifestyle, roles <span class="from_vocabulary">executed</span> by them and their place in nature - this is what is actual for scientists like me.

            No problems if you have a possibility to mine a diving suit. You can sit on a big swan and fly to the lake. You must do it not from the side of the house. The swan will brought you right. So you don't have to worry.

            I will have to negotiate with her about it. Do you see, there is necessaty to hide from eyes of the hosts. So you will have to talk somewhere in the court where the hosts will not see you. Somewhere near the lake behind the trees.
