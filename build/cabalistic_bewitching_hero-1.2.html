            You should understand the following. For people swamp is mud and muck. The table where we eat, just like everything else in our life must be clean from this filth, so you should avoid climbing here. They are right, I have an aquarium, and there you will live. This will be your living room. You can climb in the kitchen garden, at the garden, on the trees, but you should not climb at the furniture. Do not climb on the carpet, or at the windows. In general, don’t climb in the house. Aquarium is in my house, and you will live there, but don’t climb in the house.

Of course there are some algae in the aquarium. There you will be together with other marine creatures. From time to time my dog comes close to the aquarium and drinks water.

            Look, Helen. I’ve got two ideas. I do not like the <span class="from_vocabulary">hectic</span>  state of Beatriz and I really want us to <span class="from_vocabulary">appease</span>  her, so that she has not been <span class="from_vocabulary">daunted</span>  any more and she was in safety. The first idea is to fill the aquarium with sea water, instead of water from the tap, and the second one is to cover the aquarium with the bars. I can bring the bar of the right size to you.

            Does your idea <span class="from_vocabulary">imply</span>  that the water in the tank will be from our closest seas and ponds?

            Yes, I think so, it will be better than using tap water. Beatriz is used  to the marine hydrosphere. And another thought I want to express is that I think it would be better if Beatriz will not stay beyound your supervision. God forbid if your dog will <span class="from_vocabulary">assault</span>  her while she flies or walks along the garden or the yard. Therefore, it will be better if she always be in the tank, and the tank has a grating.

            I am agreed with Cassandra. It think you have to follow her opinion if you want Beatrix to be in safety.

            Do you think a grille <span class="from_vocabulary">completely</span>  ensures safety? And if Beatriz will put out her head in the lattice cell to call me and says something to me, and then dog will be just here in time? It is better for her to sit constantly in my tank and take off only when I'm around and the dog is away. I will give Beatriz some sign that this is time for going to turn, and she can get out if she wants, but it is better to be under my care, and not to fly too low.

            I am interested if Beatrix understands how these dogs look and if she can recognize a dog by looking in it. Beatrix, have you ever seen a dog in your life and are you sure that it was a dog?

            As for ideas to keep in the aquarium sea water instead of tap water, then I will consider this.

            If you want, we will help you to carry sea water from the seas. For this we need the containers. It is obvious that you yourself couldn’t pull several containers.

            Yes, of course, any help will be handy for me. Thank you very much. So, if you don’t protest I will present rules for Beatrix's living in my tank. Do you not protest?

            Fine. The first rule for Beatriz - keep aside of the aquarium surface, be as far away from it as possible. The second rule is to get out of the water only when I give the sign permitting that. The third rule is a rule of conduct <span class="from_vocabulary">outward</span>  the aquarium is to climb on the ground in the garden and on the trees only. You can also climb on the windows and on the roof of the house. Do not climb on everyday items.

            Do you think Beatriz understands what it means everyday, which means not everyday? She lived all her life only in the marsh and in the sea, there is nothing like our human worldly life. Virtually all of your living space for Beatriz is solid unfamiliar situation.

            In general, since. In the aquarium, you can climb, where you want, outside the aquarium - not in any way in the house and not in the summer kitchen. You can climb trees, on the roof of the house and the garden.

            Well, let's go Beatriz, I will tell you in detail, show and explain which zones are permitted and which are prohibited.
