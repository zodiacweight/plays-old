            Exactly! It is covered with a layer of ice with a very deep ocean wrapping all planet beneath it. Scientists believe that its depth may reach 100 km. So, if there the liquid water is established it is quite possible that the life may be found also. Just imagine ─ extraterrestrial life!

        </strong>
        <p>
            Yes, this is an interesting question. There are several hypotheses. One which is the most trustworthy is that Europa is warmed because of the gravitational field of Jupiter. During the process of rotation around him it either stretches toward him or it shrinks. This inner tension also leads to the production of warmth. At least it is exactly known that under the ice layer there is a liquid and very deep ocean!

            To be frank - no, I have not read. I have read only the first novel from this tetralogy. The next one I have started, but it has not been so interesting, not like 2001. What has been there?

            Exactly. So what then happened the following: the Chinese undertook unexpected expedition exactly to the place you was going to visit. They have sent a spaceship there, called “Tsien”. And indeed, they discovered life there!

            This creature has been apparently not very smart. At least, it had no reason. His reactions have been very primitive. It existed in a condition of lack of light, which has been important source of energy for him. And when Tsien has drilled a hole in ice layer, this creature has instinctively moved towards the source of light. After it has reached the surface, it attacked the spaceship...

            One of them - professor Chang, has been outside of the ship at the moment. Unfortunately, he could not do nothing, but merely passively observe this tragedy.

            Unfortunately, no. Despite this, during this time near Jupiter has been different spaceship, Leonov, on the board of which has been doctor Floyd, personally acquainted with professor Chang.

            It was impossible. Chang had only limited amount of oxygen and astronauts from Leonov simply did not had enough time to rescue him. They could only talk with Chang untill his oxygen has been over.
