            Good, Lady Devil. I spent these days in the aquarium of my host, communicated with her friends. They all met me with goodwill. We talked about my proposal as you know. Besides I communicated with animals in Helen's aquarium before my communication with the people.

        <p>
            Of course, I do. But, frankly, they do not differ <span class="from_vocabulary">tangibly</span> from the animals which I saw in the ocean.

        <strong data-person="Beatrix">
            Beatrix

        <p>
            Yes, I am serious. I communicated with the animals in the ocean about my life in the swamp. I talked with the animals in Helen's aquarium to the same topic. I told them the same what I told the animals in the ocean. I think both categories of the animals were interested in the same extent.

        <p>
            It means there is no <span class="from_vocabulary">tangible</span> difference between yourmconversation with the animals of one category and other one. But I have not seen yet any difference between the animals in your narrative. Maybe you wanted say that there is simillarity between them which is that all of them are equally friendly and interested in the same questions regarding to you?
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Beatrix">
            Beatrix
        </strong>
        <p>
            I don't know how to say to be true. I communicated with all of them almost to the same theme. I told them almost the same about myself and my life in the swamp. It is about what I communicated with them. I communicated with them about something completely other not so much.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Woman-devil">
            Woman-devil

        <p>
            I have no doubts that if we talk exactly about the inhabitants and not about something other what may be related with them, for example, what your communication with them. We can notice that many of them are completely different: their view, body structure, nutrition and lifestyle - the difference is very obvious.

But I want you to understand something. I want you to understand difference between you and me. It is difference between a human and a devil like me. But, unfortunately, I cannot explain you all the difference right now, because I don't know what life will you have when you are a human. But anyway your life will differ from my devil life. I hope your life will be good. I hope that you will have good parents and you will grew up a good person.
