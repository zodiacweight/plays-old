    <p>
        At least parting time has come. Of course, it is very <span class="from_vocabulary">lamentable</span> for Beatrix and Woman-devil, but they have no choice, it is necessarity for Beatrix to be a human and live in human world.,One morning Woman-devil swam to the bottom of the ocean and called Beatrix. Beatrix turned in the side from which she had heard this calling.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">

    <p>
        My dear mermaid, now I have to say you something not very pleasant. Are you ready to hear me?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">

    <p>
        Yes, I am ready.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">

    <p>
        The time has come. It is time for you and me to part however lamentable it is. You are going to adoptive parents which I have choosen for you. Today you are going to became a human and begin your life in human world. So you and me have to part.

        For some short time there was silence. It was interrupted at the moment when Woman-devil began speaking again.

    <p>
        I intend to inform you that yesterday was the last day when the Extra-decomposers specie existed. Today it does not exist. So you may return in human world. Now we are going to get in the <span class="from_vocabulary">brinks</span> of the ocean where you will be turned into a human. After that you will meet your adoptive parents. You will like them, they are good parents and good people at all. I hope you beleive me.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix

    <p>
        Yes, I beleive you, but I don't beleive that I can love somebody more than I love you. I would like to live with you more than in human world. I love you so much!
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">
        Woman-devil

    <p>
        I love you, too. But I have the <span class="from_vocabulary">undertaking</span> in front of god to release you to the human world. And you know the reason of this. Trust me, my dear. Everything will be good.

    <p>
        Of course, Beatrix was very sad from it. She liked and valued Woman-devil very much. Beatrix understood that Woman-devil had deserved a great and sincere love from her because she had <span class="from_vocabulary">reinstated</span> her possibility to live in the Earth world.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yes, it is a pity. After I will have gotten to my adoptive parents it will be difficult for me to endure the moment when you and me at least will have a new possibility to see each other again. I like my life in the ocean. I like to be with you and this <span class="from_vocabulary">abundance</span> of different species in this ocean world. I don't now very much about the world which is waiting me on the land with people.

    <p>
        Maybe I will, but however it will happen anyway I will suffer from <span class="from_vocabulary">shortfall</span> of you. I am very thankful to you for giving me life.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">

        I understand you very well. I am glad that you appreciate me for this and I wish you to be happy in the human world.

    <p>
        I promise you, we will see each-other again some time. There will be very happy days in your life. Now we are going out from this ocean. I will turn you into a human and we will meet your parents.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix

    <p>
        I will not be able to <span class="from_vocabulary">steam</span> when I will be a human. Also I will not be able to breathe water. It is a pity. Is it right?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">
        Woman-devil
    </strong>
    <p>
        I think you will not need to be able to do this. After I will have turned you into a human we will have a possibility to hug each-other.

        Beatrix and Woman-devil got to the <span class="from_vocabulary">brink</span> of the ocean from water. There Woman-devil turned Beatrix into a human as she promised. After that she and Beatrix hugged and sadly cried.

    <p>
        Sorry me, my dear, but you know, your parents can arrive at any moment. I have to be turned into a snake while thay are not here. It is with such purpose as they did not see me in my natural form and we cannot hug anymore. I know it is not pleasant for you and me, too. But it also would be not pleasant for your parents if they see me in my natural form. So I am turning into a snake as I have to do. In the main I communicate with people in this view as you know.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix
    </strong>
    <p>
        But I like your natural view more than when you are in snake view. It is not only because we can hug only when you are in your natural view. Basically it is because I used to see you in your natural view.

    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">
        Woman-devil

    <p>
        I told you that we will see each-other after you will have come to your adoptive parents and begun human life. nd when we see each-other I will try to be in my natural view if there are no some people near us who can be <span class="from_vocabulary">daunted</span> by my natural view. Everytime when you collide with very hard problems in your life you will have a possibility to <span class="from_vocabulary">summon</span> me for help. I can seep through opened windows to your room at any daily or night moment when you will need my help.

        Woman-devil turned herself into a snake. After that she and Beatrix swam and got out from the ocean. At least, Woman-devil turned Beatrix into a human. Beatrix became a little girl with legs and without wigs. Woman-devil saw Timothy and Gloria approaching to her and Beatrix.

        Hi, Beatrix and Lady Devil. I and Timothy are very pleased, too. We are very glad to do so good deal as adoption for a little unparented child. We are very sorry that you are an orphan. But we hope you had a good time while you were a beautiful marine creature. Had you not?

        I knew it! So you are lucky. Not every human has such possibility to be a marine creature for some time, live in the ocean and see its wonders. Now you will like life in our family. We promise to carry about you as natural parents.

    <p>
        But we don't want you to <span class="from_vocabulary">take offense</span> at us, Beatrix. But I have to say you that sometimes there will be some moments when we will have no possibility to play with you. We are sorry, Beatrix. I promise that we will play with you everytime when we will have such possibility. But there are different circumstances in our life. Sometimes we are too busy. We have to work hardly or <span class="from_vocabulary">comply</span> some home deals. It is very important for whole out family. It is <span class="from_vocabulary">inherent</span> part of our life.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Gloria">

    <p>
        Undoubtedly, all our games with you are <span class="from_vocabulary">undefeasible</span> part of our life. We will do it certainly. But also you have to understand that we have some other very important deals such as our job and different home deals. So we can <span class="from_vocabulary">afford</span> to play with you only when we are free from such deals. When we are not at home you will be in kindergarden or with your adoptive granny, my mummy, if you want. You will like her. She has no job now. She is a housekeeper. So you can be in her house and play with her. Also she is ready to talk you many interesting things. Your adoptive granny is ready to sacrifice some time of her time to do home work sake you. She understands how important it is to <span class="from_vocabulary">sustain</span> you. I and Timothy talked with her. She know everything.

    <p>
        Thank you very much for your intention to <span class="from_vocabulary">endorse</span> me! It is good that I will have somebody to play with very often. But the most important thing is that I have good parents who can not only play with me, but also to help me very much in my life. I know you are good people. When I have nobody to play with it is not the most <span class="from_vocabulary">lamentable</span> thing I can imagine. More <span class="from_vocabulary">lamentable</span> is to part with my good <span class="from_vocabulary">acquaintance</span> such as Woman-devil. She says that she is very sorry not to see me, too, but she has the <span class="from_vocabulary"> liability</span> in front of the God to return me into the human world because I was born a human and only according to special circumstances turned into the Extra-decomposer. So she is <span class="from_vocabulary">obliged</span> to do this and we don't have any possible ways to change this sad <span class="from_vocabulary">commitment. Mortification</span> is the only thing which remains for us. in the same time Lady Devil is perfect woman who has given me life and carried about me. So I love her so much and it is so hard for me to part with her. We hugged so firmly and warmly before this parting!

        Beatrix, I have to say you that your life is very big. There will be many different events in your life both pleasant and upleasant. You will have very much different <span class="from_vocabulary">acquaintances</span> and friends. I beleive you will have many good <span class="from_vocabulary">acquaintances</span> and it will <span class="from_vocabulary">endorse</span> you and so you will not feel sad with such reason as loneliness. Now I have to tell you something very importand. So we have to leave Gloria and Timothy for a few minutes.

        Yes, of course it is true, Lady Devil. Look at yourself. You can see at least a part of your splendid body. It is sparkling so brightly! It is difficult to look away from it! I like these inbeleiveable pretty brilliants which are glittering with so different colors: white, yellow, red, orange, pink, green, salad, light sky blue, darker blue and at least gold on the black background of your body! It is terrific in good meaning!

        The first what I have to tell you is about our current connection. When you have some problems in your life which your parents will be not able to help you to solve according to your opinion you will have a possibility to write me about them. You will write a text on a sheet of paper and put it in a box which you see now in front of us. When you put sheets with information as text into this box I will be able to read it, but not from this box. Instead I will be able to read them as your thoughts. You will take this box with yourself when you and your parents leave me. Besides I can read not only those your thoughts which will be filled with upleasant <span class="from_vocabulary">commotion</span>. Also you can just share your life with me. For example, about your adoptive grannyand your time which you have playing with her. I will be pleased to get positive information from you. You can pen me about your studying in the school if you like it and have deep positive impressions. If you feel <span class="from_vocabulary">dissaray</span> you can <span class="from_vocabulary">pen</span> me and tell about unpleasant event. I will help you with joy.

        Beatrix and Woman-devil hugged very warmly with love. It was a prolonging hugging. Beatrix felt that the reward had <span class="from_vocabulary">mollified</span> her heavy trouble despite not <span class="from_vocabulary">downright</span>. At least it had been finished and Woman-devil turned back into a snake and began speaking.

        At this moment the parting was <span class="from_vocabulary">carrying out</span>. Calm and benevolent, but a little <span class="from_vocabulary">pious</span>. Woman-devil turned and was going in direction to the ocean. The family was looking after her. Some times later they turned and were going in opposite direction. Timothy and Gloria sympathed Beatrix and Woman-devil and felt sadly for them.

        I and Timothy will do anything for you not to feel sadly. When we come home, Timothy and I will arrange a home excursion for you. We will demonstrate you all the rooms and part of the house with description.

        When Timothy, Gloria and Beatrix had arrived and Beatrix seen anything what her adoptive parents were must to show her she decided to give Christian important infrormation. But at the first she decided to tell her adoptive parents about her reward from Woman-devil. After the narrative and enthusiastic listening of her adoptive parents Beatrix wrote Christian a letter where she informed him that there were no extra-decomposers. Christian was not at home at the moment when the letter came. The letter was read by his grandpa. A little time later he called Christian to tell him about this letter and information in it. Christian had <span class="from_vocabulary">dismay</span> in his mind when he had listened that extra-decomposers time had been completed. Soon he returned home and saw the letter. There was not so much information compared with what grandpa had told him via telephone. But there was something written about past time when extra-decomposers existed in <span class="from_vocabulary">notably</span>. It was written about reasons of their existing such as different <span class="from_vocabulary">litter</span> in water of ocean and swamp where Beatriz had lived earlier. It turned out that Woman-devil created them just for <span class="from_vocabulary">refinement</span> some places in nature.,So Christian recognized that in reality motive for the existance of extra-decomposers was not so global and specific according to his current opinion compared with his early opinion.,Anyway, Christian has to think what he should engage now in his life.
