            Hi, Helen. This is Beatrix, the same extra-decomposer in human view which lived in your aquarium some times ago. I hope, you remember me. I would like know how is Christian and help him with something. I think I have found a clue for his success and I can help. Christian must visit one place where he can reach what he must reach. I would like to tell you about a place where I live now. A man <span class="from_vocabulary">wields</span> a house with a court and an <span class="from_vocabulary">immense</span> lake. I live in this lake with <span class="from_vocabulary">raft</span> of other marine inhabitants. Recently I have known something here. Here Christian has an opportunity to know very much about <span class="from_vocabulary">provenance</span> of extra-decomposers. He  must come to the lake, be under the surface of it and talk with me. Here he can know what he cannot know somewhere <span class="from_vocabulary">outwards</span> of this hydrosphere. There is very much impressive regardless <span class="from_vocabulary">provenance</span> of extra-decomposers. Besides there is one creature who is responsible for birth of extra-decomposers. If he and Christian meet each-other he can tell Christian very much about that. But he must not know that Christian considers this <span class="from_vocabulary">appointment</span> his scientific <span class="from_vocabulary">scrutiny</span>. In other words Christian can have <span class="from_vocabulary">appointment</span> with this lake inhabitant as just a guest, but not as a scientist. The devil will not approve a meeting if it is a meeting with a scientist who presumes information from communication with the devil's to <span class="from_vocabulary">play out</span> important role in his scientific career. The devil will <span class="from_vocabulary">despise</span> such interlocutor and not speak with him. Besides the human who <span class="from_vocabulary">wields</span> all this estate must not know about Christian's visit. It is possible to get into the lake by flying on a big strong swan over the fence and gates. Donâ€™t think that it is <span class="from_vocabulary">unfathomable</span> to get to the domain without host's invitation or approval. A swan approvals such visits independently from the host. He does not know about the devil living in the lake <span class="from_vocabulary">albeit</span> the lake appertain him like the court and the house. This letter was delivered to you by one of the swans which live in the demesne of this human. Anything of these words is <span class="from_vocabulary">sheer</span> true.

            Helen was a bit preoccupated with this information. It was unexpectable for her. She did not understand many things. She decided to <span class="from_vocabulary">pen</span> a response to this letter.

            Hi. Yes, I remember you. I would like you to fly to me on a swamp or independently and us to talk about anything. At first if it is as I want it to be <span class="from_vocabulary">irrefutable</span> with whom I will speak. At second we will not have to wait answers from each-other for some time. I would like to know the following. Did you discuss with the devil what if Christian visits the underwater space where you live and how this devil refers to people? What devil is this about whom you wrote in your letter? If he does not know that Christian is a scientist what will we must say him if he is interested for what purposes Christian meets with him and gets the information.

            There is regular meeting of Helen, Cassandra and Judy. The girls share news with each-other. Helen tells friends about the letter from Beatrix and the response letter which she has sent her.

            This little flying shorty with bright green but <span class="from_vocabulary">translucent</span> wigs! Yes, I remember it! It is so <span class="from_vocabulary">conspicuous</span>! I remember its bright green wigs! They are like <span class="from_vocabulary">shreds</span> of pretty and soft tissue! I remember her gentle sweet voice! These long silk hair! Anything in her view I have been remembering till this time and miss her! We have not met it for a long time. Are you serious that it wrote you?

        <p>
            It is true that I got the letter about which I have just told you. It was from her name. This letter <span class="from_vocabulary">conjured harassment</span> in my mood. The <span class="from_vocabulary">harassment</span> was closer to <span class="from_vocabulary">obscurity</span> than to <span class="from_vocabulary">incense</span>. Getting this letter was a special event. Besides I am not sure this was exactly Beatrix not a <span class="from_vocabulary">crook</span>. I wrote my response and now I am waiting the next response from the author. I do not want there be information that the author can not fly and be shown to me. So my <span class="from_vocabulary">turmoil</span> feelings will be <span class="from_vocabulary">exacerbated</span>.

        <p>
            Yes, it is an interesting question where Beatrix has learnt to write. We know she is a marine inhabitant. Then it must be she does not use writing. With whom she has to correspond except you?

        <p>
            I know nothing regarding this question, but I am agree, this is an interesting question. Maybe she lives not only in water and needs in writing now. Maybe she needs it individually for writing with me.

            Maybe she has a good teacher for learing writing. Maybe there is an english-writing school individually for specific intellectual creatures having size close to her size.

            Anyway I think it is absurd to <span class="from_vocabulary">ponder</span> about it very long, because we can not determine a <span class="from_vocabulary">sheer</span> answer to this question. At the first Helen must meet with Beatrix, of course, if the author of the letter was Beatrix and nobody another.

        <p>
            You are right, Cassandra. It is very interesting to find out all the questions. Frankly, I am a little <span class="from_vocabulary">anxious</span> about this event. It was so unexpectable!

            Helen
        </strong>
        <p>
            She wrote that she had met one creature in the lake where she lives now. This is a devil creature who can tell about provenance of the extra-decomposers.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Cassandra">
            Cassandra
        </strong>
        <p>
            And the author of the letter posited that the devil must not know that Christian is a scientist? He must think that Christian is a simple guest?
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Helen">
            Helen
        </strong>
        <p>
            It was written exactly so in the letter.

        <strong data-person="Cassandra">
            Cassandra
        </strong>
        <p>
            Maybe the devil <span class="from_vocabulary">despises</span> scientists. It is not fair if it is so. If we know about it <span class="from_vocabulary">specifically</span> and it is really like I presume, I can be <span class="from_vocabulary">incensed</span>! Scientists have all the <span class="from_vocabulary">dignities</span> for respecting!

            I thought about it, too, but I suggest not to hurry now and not to give vent to feelings earlier its time.

            Cassandra

        <p>
            I am a little anxious about such thought. Maybe this devil creature is some <span class="from_vocabulary">relentless</span> and inhuman being and Beatrix does not evaluate it as it is really? Maybe this creature is quite peaceful for her, but not for people?
        </p>

        <p>
            I understand you, it <span class="from_vocabulary">impells</span> to <span class="from_vocabulary">ponder</span> very deeply. But it is not the one question which <span class="from_vocabulary">impells</span> to ask so important questions. Besides that there is very interesting question what exactly this creature can tell Christian about these extra-decomposers and is it really so that he has not learnt it yet as a scientist and to admit Beatrix's suggestion is the one way to <span class="from_vocabulary">cope with</span> it?
