      "Some of the episodes are parody to \"Big Lebovsky\". Usually parodies are funnier and tranquiler than originals, but in this time it is on the contrary: this parody is more nightmarish than original \"Big Lebovsky\". Storie of one of the characters whose name is Quentin was like life of Jeff Lebovsky, but there is one significant difference between Quentin Stevenson and Jeff Lebovsky: Quentin is much swifter and much more agressive than this frivolous and unserious \"soplyavka\" Jeff and it was completely not a goodluck decision to go to his living territory not as diserable guests and especially climb to him. He is a strong, surdy and literally iron fight man. Besides he is very merciless, ardent, agressive, cruel maniac. So, when people interfered in his life and impeded to his quite life these were the last days in their life. Also there are some characters like characters in \"Big Lebovsky\". Mainly these were a company of idiots who ran Quentin, a dirty tart and one man related to her dirty job. All these people were literally torn when they had met this terrifying person. A murder is something completely normal for Quentin.", "There are some characters like characters in the movie \"Big Lebovsky\":",
 "<b>Quentin</b> is not like some characters of this movie, but he gets into a situation like the main character - Jeff Lebovsky, who was molesred by a few rabble cretins as if he had a financial debt and was obliged to pay it and so they had to climb to him until he would pay his debt.",
      "<b>Sophie</b> is a dirty tart who cares only about financial wealth. She is a very dirty and shameless harlot. In reality she has a debt in front of one human. This debt is not related to Quentin.",
      "<b>Mr Stephenson</b> is a tormented old oligarch who is married with Sophie. He and Sophie are Quentin's namesakes and it is related with the mistake that the company of cretins invaded into Quentin's life as if he was a debtor.",
      "<b>Vincent Kidney</b> is an outstaged character, but he is a producer of banal and low-minded movies with sexual tone and in one of them Sophie takes part as an actrice.",
      "There will be written about the characters more particularly. Sophie is in debt in front of !, but she doesn't cares about it. She is too frivolous."
