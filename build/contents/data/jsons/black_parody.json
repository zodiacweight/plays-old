Storie of one of the characters whose name is Quentin was like life of Jeff Lebovsky, but there is one significant difference between Quentin Stevenson and Jeff Lebovsky: Quentin is much swifter and much more agressive than this frivolous and unserious \"soplyavka\" Jeff and it was completely not a goodluck decision to go to his living territory not as diserable guests and especially climb to him. He is a strong, surdy and literally iron fight man. Besides he is very merciless, ardent, agressive, cruel maniac. So, when people interfered in his life and impeded to his quite life these were the last days in their life. Also there are some characters like characters in \"Big Lebovsky\". Mainly these were a company of idiots who ran Quentin, a dirty tart and one man related to her dirty job. All these people were literally torn when they had met this terrifying person. A murder is something completely normal for Quentin.", "There are some characters like characters in the movie \"Big Lebovsky\":",

      "<b>Sophie</b> is a dirty tart who cares only about financial wealth. She is a very dirty and shameless harlot. In reality she has a debt in front of one human. This debt is not related to Quentin.",

She could not make a little movement. Quentin brought an axe from a barn of Stevensons and chopped Sophie up with it. At least there was a sea of blood with Sophie's broken body. Quentin brought a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">dustbin</span> and began throw parts of heap of litter on the dry parts of Sophie's body and and burn them. So there almost nothing of Sophie's body and her blood was more similar to a shed dry paint than to a blood sea. After that Quentin found another one <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">dustbin</span> with <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">litter</span> which was bigger than the first one. Quentin rained out the <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">litter</span> form this <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">dustbin</span> on the remains of Sophie's body. So it became looking so that it was very difficult to guess that there was a dead body sometimes ago. Anything of this Quentin did accurately. It was not desirable to mr Stevenson knew that Quentin had killed Sophie. He does not know about it for now, but reekness from the place where Sophie had been killed and rained with <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">litter</span> was horrible. Quentin did not sniff it long. He went from this place just he had rained the <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">litter</span>.",
            "For what mr Stevenson to kiss Quentin into ass was that Quentin did not kill him and helped him to get rid of the encumbrance Sophie. And, of course, Quentin saved life of mr Stevenson by not internalizing this. If Quentin had not killed Sophie the beast will catch to hair a killer to kill Nick and be gotten rid of him.",
            "There were some good people, <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">acquaintances</span> of Stevensons who came, moved the table from mr Stevenson and helped him to rise up.",
            "The producer who was must to get these money from Sophie was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">detrimented</span> very much that he knew nothing about where were his money. One day he knew that Sophie was killed, also he knew that there was something wrong with her spose. So the producer knew nothing about his money which were Sophie's debt. Who could return them to him in this moment - it was completely misunderstandable. So the producer decided that he <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">ignorantly</span> had escaped them and so he was stressed very much. He twitched in a fit and after that he could not eat and go to the toilet normally. His waste streamed from his genitals before he caught to reach his toilet. The producer was taken by ambulance and brought to the hospital where he was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">incited</span> to be in one medical cabinet. Doctors fed him intravenously and nurses cleared up floor, coach, berth and the walls of this cabinet from his waste."]}
