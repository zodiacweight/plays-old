Her height was lower than Judy's height. It reached Judy's lips. Eyes were very big and their form was more similar to circles than to form of human eyes. Accordingly to it her edge were so big. Hair was in thick and long scythe ending lower her polly. Accordingly to Judy's feelings Woman-devil's hair were very dense like toy's hair. Her polly was visibly wider than the part of her body from shoulders till waist. It seemed <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">daunt</span> to  Judy. She did not like it at the first moment.
