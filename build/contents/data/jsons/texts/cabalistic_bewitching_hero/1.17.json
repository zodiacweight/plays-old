I remember your narrative about this terrifying body: this eye on the one of halfs of the ass, this tail with brush on its end, horns, big clutches. I remember you told about this fascinating event! You went in a forest and suddenly stumbled upon so strange picture - a creature like a human, but naked with all these wonders! I remember you told with expressive intonation how <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">overhelming</span> it was. Besides this I remember you told about a scary creature which you had seen in a forest. It was somebody like a big wild predatory beast and you run away spending all your forces. It was very <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">breathtakingly</span>, and it was why you could not to continue science after that.
