I have legs like human legs which my tail is on. But there are some difference from the bodies point of view. I have double respiratory system. So I have <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">aptitudes</span> to breathe with water not only air and live in water space dislike people. In the same time I can communicat  with people through their language. There is difference between me and people regarding lifestyle and sustentation. It is naturally that my life is in water. I have some similarities with insects. I have wigs like wigs of a butterfly. I can fly through these wigs. Also the wigs serve me as drift-woods of a marine inhabitant. I swim through them in water. As I have already said I lived in the swamp in the ocean after that and in the river the at last time. I <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">mined</span> feed for myself. I had a good friend frog in the swamp. Unfortunately the circumstances like these <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hinder</span> our communication now.

There are some other animals like us in this aquarium. You will see them later. We did not know each other until we were <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">coalesced</span> into one company in this aquarium. We were <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">abdicated</span> from the ocean not according to our own will. Were you gotten here according your own will?"]},
          {"Beatrix": ["I <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">abdicated</span> from the swamp to see the world from other sides. I had such desire to see what is here. And right now I can <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">posit</span> something regarding this place and other places where I lived earlier. The ocean is so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immence</span> compared with the space of this tank."]},
          {"Marine star": ["I think the space of this aquarium is enough <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">far-flung</span>. The depth particulary is large and I like it."]},
          {"Tortoise female": ["But the space is not such <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">far-flung</span> for Crab as it is for us. I think how large is depth is not so matter for him. Unfortunately he does not swim. He always is only on the bottom."]},

I like <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sleek</span> places of the bottom more than places covered with stones. Beatrix, can you <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">solicit</span> our host to leave more places uncovered when she change water next time?"]},

          {"Crab": ["There is another catfish who is sleeping now behind it. There are also some other animals in our aquarium who is in the castle now. I would like all of us to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">attend</span> in our general <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">allotment</span> in this castle sometimes and you to tell about yourself more. Your appearance in our congregation is a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">grander</span> event. But we have to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">postpone</span> our general meeting because some animals are not ready to it at the moment."]},
          {"Beatrix": ["I remember my host <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">conjured</span> me to stay away from the surface of our water space because otherwise it may be dangerous. The danger is in her dog who can <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">afford</span> to make us its <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">booty</span>. She <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">daunted</span> me with her dog. It seems her dog is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">merciless</span>. I think it is a predatory animal."]},
          {"Tortoise female": ["Yes, I am agree with you. But I am sure just <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">complience</span> her instructions means we have no reasons to be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">anxious</span> about our lives. The dog has no possibilities to perpetuate into our space."]},
          {"Beatrix": ["She <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">conjured</span> me to do as she said. I understand her, but she has covered the surface with something. Is it not too much? To be frankly I would have <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">inclination</span> to walk out of this aquarium because there is much interesting things outside. I would be careful about my security."]},
          {"Tortoise female": ["We compassionate you, but we can help with nothing to you. You can discuss this problem with the host if you have not discussed it yet to the enough extent."]},
          {"Marine star": ["I think the fact that surface is covered is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">instructive</span> for you. It is covered not intentionally. How can you know you are always in safety when you are out of the tank?"]},
          {"Crab": ["I presume there is necessarity of <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hurdles</span> for the dog to reach the surface of out space with its tongue. Maybe our host is anxious about us."]},
          {"Beatrix": ["But I am sure I have enough <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">discretion</span> not to get into irreparable trouble."]},
          {"Crab": ["I would like all of us including the animals who have not seen you yet to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">attend</span> in our general meeting with you in the castle. It will be a nice <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">venue</span>. You may not be coy in surrounding of them. Do not be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">daunted</span> if it seems to you as they are a bit in <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">obscurity</span> looking at you. It will be because they have not accustomed to see and communicate with animals like you. But at least they understand that there is overabundance of different marine animal species and probabilities to meet somebody unusual of them. I know nobody of them will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">retreat</span> from you soon."]},

          {"Crab": ["Well, lets go to our castle and organize our meeting with everybody of us. Call other inhabitants."]},
          {"Author's words": ["There all of the inhabitants are on their general meeting in the castle."]},
          {"Marine star": ["I am glad that all of us are here including Beatrix. I think you all are glad, too. Lets plop her."]},
          {"Tortoise male": ["Nice. Lets inquiry Beatrix to tell us about herself everybody of us to hear."]},
          {"Beatrix": ["Well, I am glad you are interested. I will try. I am a hybrid being. There are some evidences of other live species such as human, insect and also I have evidence of a marine animal, of course. People call me a mermaid, but I am not a mermaid in reality. Mermaid is a girl whose top half of body is human and bottom half is fish. My body is human <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">altogether</span> exept something inside. But there is something that differs me from people. It is my double respiratory system. It allows me breath water and air. In the same time people have otherwise respiratory system and can not breath water. I can communicate with people, understand them and tell my thoughts in words. I have wigs like wigs of a butterfly. I can fly through my wigs like a butterfly. Also they serve me as drift-woods."]},
          {"Tortoise female": ["It is interesting. I saw a creature like you at once when I lived in an ocean. Yes, you are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">akin</span> a human."]},
          {"Catfish female": ["Can you tell us how have you appeared in this aquarium?"]},
          {"Beatrix": ["I lived in a swamp. After that I decided to live in an ocean because I wanted to see the world. I knew there is something exept the swamp in the world. I flew from the swamp to the ocean. I communicated with different marine animals in the ocean. I saw animals like you. The ocean was a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">venue</span> of interesting acquaintances. I am glad I was there. The animals told me about themself very much. The topic which I like very much is marine nature."]},
          {"Catfish female": ["How did you get into our aquarium?"]},
          {"Beatrix": ["I lived in a river after living in the ocean. At once a fisherman caught me. He understood that I am an unusual marine and humanoid in the same time creature and he knew our host. He knew she had an aquarium and would not <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">rebuff</span> from such pet as me. He brought me to her gate and I flew to her and get acquainted with her. Since that moment I have been living here."]},
          {"Catfish female": ["We hope you like to live here."]},
          {"Crab": ["She is a bit <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">lamentable</span> about her friendship with a frog which has ceased. The frog lives in the swamp. She and Beatrix had friendship when Beatrix lived in the swamp."]},

I'll ask somebody of people who are acquainted with me to bring me to the swamp. I will try to see my friend."]},

          {"Catfish male": ["Was Darma warned that it was possible that she would never see you again?"]},
          {"Beatrix": ["She hopes someday we would see each-other again. She perceives there is such probability we would never see each-other again, but she wants us to meet someday again."]},
          {"Tortoise female": ["Can she speak with people?"]},
          {"Beatrix": ["No, she can't."]},
          {"Tortoise female": ["Do you have any ideas when you can see her again?"]},
          {"Beatrix": ["No, I don't. I must talk to Helen in the begining. Helen is our host. I can discuss the trip to the swamp with her. Maybe she or the fishman who found me can bring me to the swamp."]},
          {"Catfish male": ["Maybe Darma would live here."]},
          {"Catfish female": ["Maybe not. It depends of how host refers to frogs."]},
          {"Tortoise female": ["Did you have any friends except Darma in the swamp?"]},
          {"Beatrix": ["Yes, I did. But Darma was my special friend. She always understood and supported me. Also I refered to her."]},
          {"Tortoise female": ["Was there somebody whom you liked in the ocean?"]},
          {"Beatrix": ["There were a lot of different animals in the ocean. There were more animals than in the swamp. It was joyously, but it is not enough without Darma."]},
          {"Tortoise male": ["Only you can <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">glide</span> how to meet Darma again and communicate with her because you have possibility to talk to people who can help you to reach the swamp where you lived."]},
          {"Catfish female": ["I hope, you like us. Tell us, please. Do you like in this water space?"]},
          {"Beatrix": ["Frankly, it is a bit close. There was so much space and different animals in the ocean! In the same time there are only a few ones of us and not so much of space here."]},
          {"Catfish female": ["I understand you. Here we are in the <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">confined</span> space, but it is so wonderful view! Pay your attention at them! What else I can hint at - you can discuss your decision about your inhabitant with our host. We can not. We were <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">mustered</span> into this aquarium independently from our own will."]},
