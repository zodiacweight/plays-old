At the same time not anybody of them thinks about people of the faithful category as about crazy and wacky people. At least it is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">pertinent</span> to beleive in superheroes in Los Angeles, but not everybody beleives in them.", "Sometimes happened some very interesting situations in Los Angeles: people saw somebody like a superhero who helped them in hard situations. After that this information was reported in news, but other people, who might hear and watch via television these news, but did not see no one superhero in their real life. could beleive or not beleive that anything in the news could be a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sheer</span>  true. How they can know? Maybe the tv-program was made for public to get financial success thought television, but the news were not true.", "This is a storie about one optimistic human who met with the great superhero. Ramon was invited in a arrangement by his friends. They assigned a certain day, time and place for this meeting. At the assigned day Ramon played cards with one of his friends. Later his friends left him and went home to do his <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">undertakings</span>. Ramon was watching news and concert at the tv until the time when his alarm sounded.
