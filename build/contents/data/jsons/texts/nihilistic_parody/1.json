        {"Sophie": ["I was in my job, of course. Do you think I did not tell you where I was going to go?"]},
        {"Author's words": ["Sophie closed the door after herself and pass to the <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">lounge</span>. On the <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">lounge</span> she put one her leg on other leg and laid her hands out at the sides.", "At the same moment Nick went to the radio in his armchair and turned it off."]},
        {"Nick": ["You mean prostitution, don't you? You are not able for some bigger <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">denomination</span>, are you?"]},
        {"Sophie": ["Prostitution is quite normal for me. You know it. And what's than?"]},
        {"Nick": ["I am <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">anxious</span> about something. It is about your debt in front of the producer of the movies in which you take part."]},

If you are obstinate you can make me <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">incense</span> through your idiotism! Don't you understand through your <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">frigging dogged</span> brain what <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">consequences</span> may be after your frivolity regarding your financial <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">liability</span> to pay to your producer?"]},

        {"Sophie": ["The situation is not so serious as you think, dear. You may calm down and listen to me if you like to be in calm mental mood more than in the mood almost histerical. My producer is not so clever as you presume. He is not clever to such extent to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">cope with</span> a situation successfully when somebody has a debt in front of him."]},
        {"Nick": ["How!? What does it mean he is not very clever!? He is so rich and successfull man that my thoughts about his life make me to be tormented by my <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">envy</span> to him! It is scary to imagine how much money he gets after every his movie."]},

There are some people who is crazy about pornographic movies like the movies of Vincent Kidney and it is not extremely rare case. His movies are very popular and so he is enough rich. Do you <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">envy</span> him because of his wealth which is bigger than your wealth or because he is a yong healthy man in perfect form unlike you?"]},
        {"Nick": ["Seems to me you are a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">completed</span> idiot. You have told something <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">completely ludicrous</span> and besides abused me! Our current conversation is not related with the fact about Vincent Kidney's financial status. At least you could respect me, the human who is much older than you, the man who has lived a long life! I want you very much to listen me carefully. Moreover I want you to grasp my idea. It is enough important! Now I have to tell not about my <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">frigging envy</span> to Vincent Kidney! I have to tell about my <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">dissaray</span> regarding probable <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sequel</span> of your debt in front of Vincent Kidney! Seems to me you don't understand what exactly doesn't keep me calm. You don't understand that it can be so disadvantaged <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">consequence</span> such as we can meet very bad people in our own living place. There will be people trying to beat Vincent Kidney's money out of us! It won't be funny, I assure you! These people will not joke or play with us!"]},

        {"Sophie": ["You may shut up right now! Now it is my turn to speak! I don't intend to listen you too long! Anyway I understand what you would like to say, but I don't need this infromation from you right now. What you wanted to tell me is not new for me. So I said you to shut up. It will be much more better if you listen me now instead of I would listen you so long. And don't call me a fool or a tart like you like to call me. If you continue doing this rather you will have many troubles than I will or we will have together."]},

He already had not had desire to tell it <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">specially</span>.

        {"Nick": ["What good thing can tell me a fool like you?"]},
        {"Sophie": ["So now I hope you are ready to listen. I am going to explain what I meant when I said that Vincent Kidney is not so clever as you think. I meant that he would not do everything not to be wrong regarding his debtors who take part in his movies. He is not so clever to get his money correctly, trust me."]},
        {"Nick": ["Really? And what expresses this?"]},

You also are a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sheer</span> washed-fool and traitor! You decided to move your  <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">frigging</span> problems on other human who is absolutely innocent in this case!"]},

        {"Nick": ["I wanted to talk to you as a human with other understanding human, but I wasn't lucky because of your imbecility. If I had not you, but a clever intelligent person I would be much more lucky. And also the day would be much more lucky! But now you are going away from here in order me not to see you!"]},

        {"Nick's answer to himself": ["No, I don't beleive it! Is is too difficult and unbeleiveable! How a dirty and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">abhorrent</span> slut like this one can live in my house and be married with me!? I remember my previous marriage. I was married with a real worthy of respect woman named Ophelia who had earned good money for what we bought all this estate. She was a nice woman at all. She understood me very well everytime. But one day she died because of one hard illness. I even don't want to repeat to myself what illness it was. I thought we were ones of the happiest people of this planet until it happened. Of course, death of my precious Ophelia was tragic for me. I barely regained consciousness after this terrible event. I decided that loneliness would be too heavy load for me and wanted to marry again. Earlier I liked Sophie, but later I found who she is... Besides I fell that it is heavy to divorse with her because of my great estate."]},
        {"Nick's second answer": ["Yes, Nick. You have to confess with this and with the fact that you cannot rewind time of your life back and see your wonderful Ophelia instead of this whore."]},
        {"Author's words": ["Sophie was unpleasantly surprised that Nick had cursed her with dirty words. She never expected it from him. She even did not span class=\"from_vocabulary\">contemplate</span> about such idea as the idea that Nick could get the idea that Sophie had gotten married hims only just to use his wealth and be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">incensed</span> because of this circumstance. After this conversation she began to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">reflect</span> her plans to get rid of Nick so as it would cost his life. She does not love and appreciate him. She just uses his money in marriage with him. It is not so matter whether he is alive or not. She was sitting in other room and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">speculating</span> about her idea very deeply. She was not considered to pay her debt. Her opinion was that it was not necessary.", "After this empty conversation Sophie and Nick almost did not see each-other. Sometimes it happened so that Nick saw how Sophie went past him when she was going somewhere in the house. But Nick and Sophie lived their own life each-other separately.", "One day Sophie whispered so as Nick did not hear:"]},
        {"Sophie": ["Don't worry, dear. There only a few days are remaining, every day less and less until the term will be completed and then we will never see each-other again!"]}
