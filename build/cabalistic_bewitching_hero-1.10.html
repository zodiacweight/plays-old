        Judy and Cassandra are coming in the court and sitting in the lounge.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">
        Judy

    <p>
        I am always glad to be your host, Helen, because we are true friends. But I see you are looking a bit <span class="from_vocabulary">sullen</span>. What's happened?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        I think about the story Beatrix told us last time when we talked threesome: you, me and her. The story was <span class="from_vocabulary">shril</span>.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">
        Judy
    </strong>
    <p>
        This little flying shorty again! Do you mind that there are many other <span class="from_vocabulary">grander</span> things in the world?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen

    <p>
        Of course, but I am not indifferent to such attractive and good creature.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">
        Cassandra

    <p>
        What kind of story it was?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        Last time when Judy visited me and you was busy with your work Beatrix told us her <span class="from_vocabulary">lamentable</span> story. It was about her <span class="from_vocabulary">provenance</span>. Earlier she was a human. There was one tragical event in result of which her life was <span class="from_vocabulary">ceased prematurely</span>. What we see now is her <span class="from_vocabulary">epitome</span> into this body of a decomposer after her human life.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">
        Cassandra
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yes, it is impressive. What was the reason of her death?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        Her organism was very defective because her parents were alcoholics. She does not know concretely what illness she had.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">
        Cassandra
    </strong>
    <p>
        It is a pity that she had tragic end, died in earlier age. How is Beatrix now at all? Does she <span class="from_vocabulary">abide</span> her security measures? Does she not <span class="from_vocabulary">breach</span> from your aquarium without your <span class="from_vocabulary">overseeing</span>?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        No, she was very <span class="from_vocabulary">resigned</span> and obedient last time. Now she has left me and flew from me to the nature.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">
        Cassandra
    </strong>
    <p>
        It is definitely.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        I know. It is a <span class="from_vocabulary">lamentable</span> case that she can not go to the holidays with us. I would wish her long and happy life in this <span class="from_vocabulary">epitome</span>.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">
        Cassandra
    </strong>
    <p>
        I would like you to tell me how you and Judy spend your free time without me. You and Judy are more free than me now. I know you may see each other almost every day now. In the same time I am not such free as you. I continue working as a photographer.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        Often we play tennis and engage some sport exercises. Also we sit here and talk about something what is related to our friendship. It is approximately like we have time all three: me, you and Judy.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">
        Judy

    <p>
        Yes, it does not different from time when we are all three in our meeting.

        Christian will be here with us soon. He promised to be with us for some time and communicate with us.

    <strong data-person="Cassandra">

        Are you serious? It seemed his work was so <span class="from_vocabulary">ongoing</span>!
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        I am serious, trust me. He works very <span class="from_vocabulary">obstinately</span> and <span class="from_vocabulary">rigorously</span>, but sometimes he needs pauses and rest from his working. Now he has some free time to be with us or speak with his relatives.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">
        Cassandra

    <p>
        It is cool! When he's going to arrive?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">

        He will arrive soon in a little time.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">
        Cassandra
    </strong>
    <p>
        Will we may <span class="from_vocabulary">inquire</span> about his purposes which he is <span class="from_vocabulary">striving</span> for?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        I think, we will. I hope you can <span class="from_vocabulary">inquire</span> about that and get answers to the questions.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">
        Judy

    <p>
        I am interested in the story <span class="from_vocabulary">particularly</span>.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">

    <p>
        I am, too.

        Judy
    </strong>
    <p>
        Helen, do you know what <span class="from_vocabulary">statements</span> to achieve his purposes and end were in his previous life?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        I do not know that in <span class="from_vocabulary">particular</span>. I talk with him not very often. He is always <span class="from_vocabulary">fraught</span> with his work as I told you.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">
        Cassandra
    </strong>
    <p>
        It is enough intriguingly for me. I believe he will <span class="from_vocabulary">cope with</span> achieving the purposes he has determined in this life, but I am heavy waiting when he will do that!
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        I am concerned in successful outcome in his engagement, too. My opinion is that scientists <span class="from_vocabulary">merit</span> to be successful and happy in their life.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">
        Judy
    </strong>
    <p>
        As I remember we have not <span class="from_vocabulary">glided</span> anything what relates to our holidays yet. May we switch the theme of our conversation?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yes, of course, but when Christian arrives we be <span class="from_vocabulary">compelled</span> to <span class="from_vocabulary">set aside</span> the conversation on this theme. Christian intends to devote this time to us with such hopeless that this time will be suitable to be spent for <span class="from_vocabulary">inquiring</span> all about what interests us in his job. He has not too much free time for abstraction from his job and we must devote this time to what he is being <span class="from_vocabulary">diverted</span> for.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">
        Judy
    </strong>
    <p>
        Of course. What shall we do else? But I want us to tell about our holidays while he is not with us. So there is an actual and pertinent question what time will he arrive.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Helen">
        Helen
    </strong>
    <p>
        He said he would arrive between 12 and 1.

    <strong data-person="Christian">

    <p>
        In my previous life I did not finish anything what I was must finish. All the scientists are <span class="from_vocabulary">fond</span> with their job very much. I am not an exception. There are no exceptions among the scientists. So I intend to do that in this life.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Cassandra">
        Cassandra
    </strong>
    <p>
        I know. I listened about that from Helen. What is it if to tell more concrete? Was there something <span class="from_vocabulary">unfathomable</span> in your previous life to be a successful scientist?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Christian">
        Christian
    </strong>
    <p>
        I had so <span class="from_vocabulary">immense</span> inclination as in this life. I conducted <span class="from_vocabulary">inquiries</span> in such scientific area as decomposers. There was one unfavorable case in my job. At one moment I collided with one understandable fact. One day I meet a very strange looking creature in a forest.
    </p>

        Was this what really <span class="from_vocabulary">played out</span> such negative role?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Christian">

    <p>
        Yes, it was. I began my <span class="from_vocabulary">inquiry</span>, but I had not could <span class="from_vocabulary">cope with</span> my destination. It was too featured. It was something unimaginably <span class="from_vocabulary">striking</span>. But I have not concluded that it is something <span class="from_vocabulary">superfluous</span> and I <span class="from_vocabulary">purport</span> to find out this secret in my current life. I know now epoch has changed. Such phenomena as extra-decomposers are norm in our epoch unlike the epoch when I lived my in previous life. So I am not thought as about a crazy man.

    <p>
        It is a story which will seem enough <span class="from_vocabulary">shril</span> for human perception, but I see you are enough interested. I collided with some special entities when I learnt extra-decomposers. I was a bit shocked but not deeply. The creature looked very surprising. It was just <span class="from_vocabulary">striking</span>! It was like a daemon. It had bright-red eyes glowing in the dark, long clutches and hissed at me!

        I <span class="from_vocabulary">scarcely</span> did not go mad when I saw it. I turned and run away <span class="from_vocabulary">hastily</span> from the forest. It <span class="from_vocabulary">played out</span> very negative role in my life. I told different people about this accident. I could not hold it in my secret. The words about this scene <span class="from_vocabulary">breached</span> textually from me. People decided that I was crazy. So I lost right to engage science after that. I was <span class="from_vocabulary">confined</span> in a madhouse where I died <span class="from_vocabulary">prematurely</span> from heavy yearning by such reason as science <span class="from_vocabulary">shortage</span>.

        Yes, Christian, you were right. The story is <span class="from_vocabulary">shril</span> really. It is unfair that some unknown creatures <span class="from_vocabulary">hinder</span> to success in a scientist's life and lead them to <span class="from_vocabulary">lamentable</span> end.

        So as you know my possibility to continue engaging in science area was <span class="from_vocabulary">reinstated</span> when I had been born in this life and become 3 years old.

        In this time we know about such creatures almost nothing. Now they are thought as about real creatures which exist not only in imagination of a crazy person, they also exist <span class="from_vocabulary">outwards</span> of a crazy person's imagination in real world, but we know that they are somebody like daemons. Now I am working not in night time when it is not so scary.

        Of course, I do. I like <span class="from_vocabulary">pondering</span> nature laws and make new discoveries and improve opened discoveries. Science engagement is an <span class="from_vocabulary">inalienable</span> part of my life. I have <span class="from_vocabulary">epitomized</span> in this my life exactly for this purpose. I just the same can not have this life without it. So I <span class="from_vocabulary">downright</span> do not want be a usual child.

        I evaluate my engagement as successful and meaningful work. Sometimes I am <span class="from_vocabulary">impelled</span> to <span class="from_vocabulary">exert</span> my mental forces and <span class="from_vocabulary">rack my brains</span> in sciences, but I like it. It is so mysteriously and as if it is enchantingly. But I have not only good news. There are some <span class="from_vocabulary">hurdles</span> to the success performing my mission. I do not like people who are <span class="from_vocabulary">hectic</span> to believe in some unusual phenomena. For example, my granny who is enough <span class="from_vocabulary">incisive</span> person in my life. Sometimes she impedes me to work with her <span class="from_vocabulary">hectic unrests</span>.

    <p>
        She behaves like a crazy <span class="from_vocabulary">superannuated</span> idiot. She almost <span class="from_vocabulary">hectically</span> philosophizes that I am a supernatural human and it is not normal. I am fed with her emotional <span class="from_vocabulary">trepidation</span> and I do not know how to <span class="from_vocabulary">placate</span> her mood. She <span class="from_vocabulary">scarcely</span> is not going mad. Sometimes it <span class="from_vocabulary">summons resentment</span> in me. It <span class="from_vocabulary">boils down</span> that sometimes she <span class="from_vocabulary">hampers</span> my working process and also I <span class="from_vocabulary">hinder</span> calm in her life.

        Is she <span class="from_vocabulary">hectic</span> by the reason referred to the <span class="from_vocabulary">discrepancy</span> between your age and character, attitude and capacity?

    <strong data-person="Christian">

        I listened about <span class="from_vocabulary">dissemination</span> of such specific children as you, Christian. I read about them in papers. There are many children who have such <span class="from_vocabulary">innate</span> aptitudes as you and are <span class="from_vocabulary">entitled</span> to work as scientists in so early age. Did you hear about it?
