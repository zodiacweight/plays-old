            She is glad. I am glad, too. We went to the swamp where she lived earlier. She saw her best friend frog which she had missed before her life in my tank. I bought a map where I can learn ways to the swamp. Sam brought us there and back with his car. It was a far distance. It <span class="from_vocabulary">turned out</span> that he is brilliant in the space we crossed!  He <span class="from_vocabulary">contemplated</span> the map, took a look at the swamp and we came without <span class="from_vocabulary">fallacies</span>. Thank you for interest.

            It is possible to <span class="from_vocabulary">tame</span> such creatures and it was not difficult in my case, but, unfortunately, they are not for keeping at home by people. Neither me nor Christian have not told you yet about the species Beatrix belongs to. Its existence is connected with one <span class="from_vocabulary">grander</span> but unpleasant event on our planet. They are performing their mission to prevent a catastrophic <span class="from_vocabulary">aftermath</span>. They eat carrion which <span class="from_vocabulary">contaminates</span> nature. So they have to live in nature and not to be pets. So I will have to <span class="from_vocabulary">relinquish</span> Beatrix.

        <p>
            Of course, it is negative news. But besides that I am worrying about the catastrophe which you have just mentioned.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Helen">
            Helen
        </strong>
        <p>
            Recently I made a visit to Christian and he mentioned it. But there was his grandma with us. She <span class="from_vocabulary">demanded</span> him not to tell about the catastrophe because she was <span class="from_vocabulary">hectic</span> about that. So I did not listen about it and I do not know what a catastrophe is it.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Judy">
            Judy
        </strong>
        <p>
            The fact about the catastrophe is not sumptuously, of course, but I would like to know about it and know that it will be not global.
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Helen">

        <p>
            Extra-decomposers are for <span class="from_vocabulary">caveat</span> nature to escape catastrophe. In essence they are <span class="from_vocabulary">hatched</span> in the world for this purpose and with no other one. In reality Beatrix is not a mermaid. Maybe you have already understood it, maybe not.  At leastways she is not a mermaid like all the mermaids about which we could listen in fairy-tales. She is a particular scavenger. The species Beatrix belongs to is called extra-decomposers but wherein Beatrix is a specific representative of this species. She has some essential differences from other representatives of this species. When they do what they are doing they will disappear from the world.

            Do you <span class="from_vocabulary">imply</span> their existence is not <span class="from_vocabulary">perpetual</span>?
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Helen">
            Helen

            It is very specific and more depressing. All the live species have other existence limit. Is the mission of such beings as Beatrix <span class="from_vocabulary">refinement</span> some places on our planet from the carrion overage?
        </p>
        <strong data-person="Helen">
            Helen
        </strong>
        <p>
            Of course, it is as I said. They are called extra-decomposers and have mission of nature <span class="from_vocabulary">janitors</span>. This mission is <span class="from_vocabulary">refinement</span> nature from a global carrion pollution.

        <p>
            Does Beatrix presume to have a <span class="from_vocabulary">perpetual abode</span> or she presumes to live everywhere if there is carrion?

            I do not know exactly but I think she pretends to live in some other different places. I see she has interest to see the world in many different places. I think she will not want to live in some other aquarium of some other people because it is too tight for her. It is a disadvantage of life in my aquarium <span class="from_vocabulary">albeit</span> I think it is enough <span class="from_vocabulary">cumbersome</span> for such quantity of inhabitants of such size.

            Oh, I have just found that I have never touched on this question in the conversation with Christian. Nobody of my acquainted can know it better than he does. But I have understood that extra-decomposers are going to be <span class="from_vocabulary">superfluous</span> part of anything alive in our planet when they complete their mission.

            I would like us to go to Miami. Besides the beach there is an engrossing water museum in this city. I am going to tell you about a marine game. The game is <span class="from_vocabulary">carried out</span> in huge aquariums in the museums of Miami. There are many different games which are <span class="from_vocabulary">carried out</span> in the <span class="from_vocabulary">immense</span> aquariums. The players are <span class="from_vocabulary">entitled</span> to put on diving suits and get into the aquariums where they take part of the game. Every player takes a basket before game starting. When I read about them in magazines, I had such impression that they are akin some sport games. I read about not to say <span class="from_vocabulary">immense plethora</span> of games but I am very interested of them and I think you will like it, too. I can tell you about some of those games in particular. Many of them have similarities. It is that they are based on quick movement in the water. The principle is following. We <span class="from_vocabulary">plunge</span> into water and sit on the backs of dolphins and merpeople and wear to them with <span class="from_vocabulary">cohesive</span> chains. There will be some bright objects quickly moving in different directions in the water discarded by a game leader. We <span class="from_vocabulary">purport</span> to catch the objects earlier than our foes. So our marine inhabitants will serve us as a vehicles. They will <span class="from_vocabulary">sweep</span> in the water and their purpose is to obtain such <span class="from_vocabulary">vantage point</span> where we can reach out our hand and touch the object. We will have to <span class="from_vocabulary">strive</span> reach the object and touch it according to our purpose and put it in the basket. So we <span class="from_vocabulary">purport</span> to <span class="from_vocabulary">muster</span> as many objects as we can. There will be some <span class="from_vocabulary">hurdles</span> for the movement to be easy in hurry. There will be such <span class="from_vocabulary">hurdles</span> as some objects we will must <span class="from_vocabulary">sweep</span> past and not offend. The objects will be such as <span class="from_vocabulary">dustbins</span> and <span class="from_vocabulary">rattlesnakes</span>, but they will be not natural. They are only called so. They are such objects only from the game <span class="from_vocabulary">vantage point</span>. But the players must not offend no one of them and if somebody bumps in some of these object he or she will exit from the game. Every caught object gives one or two points to the player catching hold it dependently of size of the object. In this game we all are rivals for each-other. But we can play with (teams) commands and then the commands will play roles of opponents for each-other.
        </p>

            I have understood that the beings who will serve us as vehicles be responsible for our achievements?

        <strong data-person="Helen">
            Helen
        </strong>
        <p>
            Of course. This is their game, too. There was such <span class="from_vocabulary">caveat</span> where I read about the games that these beings have not weak <span class="from_vocabulary">vigor what serves them giving <span class="from_vocabulary">aptitudes</span> to quick speed in this game. Also I read they are not being <span class="from_vocabulary">enfeebled</span> during a long game time. So we must hold on tight with them. But if somebody <span class="from_vocabulary">topples</span> it is not so <span class="from_vocabulary">tangible</span> negative as <span class="from_vocabulary">bumping</span>. The player who will <span class="from_vocabulary">topple</span> be returned back with help of his live vehicle.

            Rather no than yes. They are not natural and the game is played in the water. Besides people who play in this game breath with air stored in the diving helmets, as you know. So they can not feel smell which <span class="from_vocabulary">pertain</span> water.

            I will <span class="from_vocabulary">mollify</span> your <span class="from_vocabulary">turmoil</span> feelings. I think I have already read about this game and understood that there is no necessity for players of having very strong nerves. You will be <span class="from_vocabulary">clutched</span> with the animal with a <span class="from_vocabulary">cohesive</span> nexus. The nexuses are used with the purpose of reducing falling possibility. To say more you will not suffer <span class="from_vocabulary">tangibly</span> if you <span class="from_vocabulary">topple</span> from your vehicle. The game will be played in water where anything falls not very quickly. If you reach the bottom in your falling you will not be injured. May be your quick live vehicle will have catch you before you fly to the bottom. You will only have to climb onto its back. Anyway it is a large possibility that you will not be injured because it is going on in water and the nexus are used to help the players to return on their diving spaces. Sometimes it seems to me such game will be an <span class="from_vocabulary">indispensable</span> entertainme.

            Judy, Helen and Cassandra stay in the garden in a tree-shade. Lovely warm day, in the middle of May, sunshine, sounds of birds and aroma of flowers. The bell rings at the door. An unknown man enters the house. He is is tall, with large expressive eyes, of indeterminate age. He wears summer t-shirt and a cowboy hat.

            James shrinks to the size of Beatrix and got two bright-blue wigs. He flies around and sings some rock song, probably from Within Temptation and the music accompanies him as he flies. Cassandra  loses her senses. Helen and Judy pour a jar of water into her face and Cassandra opens her eyes again. James returns fastly to his original human shape, his transformation is accompanied with a light-flesh.
