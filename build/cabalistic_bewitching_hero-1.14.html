        Judy, Beatrix and Woman-devil take part in this part. Judy is visiting Woman-devil's living place and meet her together with Beatrix. Beatrix and Judy negotiated that Beatrix would write to Woman-devil a letter where she would discuss date, time and place of meeting. Before Judy came her friends were not <span class="from_vocabulary"> squared off </span> by the question about Judy's walking to Woman-devil.

        But I don't trust this prejudices. I do not like your <span class="from_vocabulary">tumult, </span> but I like the idea. I have Beatrix who <span class="from_vocabulary">warants</span> that there is no serious <span class="from_vocabulary">menace</span> for us. Let her be responsible for her words. And <span class="from_vocabulary">Resignation</span> is the one what remains to you.

    <p>
        I don't have impression <span class="from_vocabulary"> fertility </span>. I am a monster another breed unlike you two. Woman-devil can feel who is in front of her and our not natural human view is not a <span class="from_vocabulary">hurdle</span> for her to know who we really are. Because of I am not such monster as both of you are, I can not worry about Woman-devil's relationships with me as you can because the breed which I belong doesn't have many signs similiar to her signs. I read much about it. I will not <span class="from_vocabulary"> abdicate</span> the unusual intriguing proposal of Beatrix. I think it will be  something just <span class="from_vocabulary">pulsatile</span> to meet with those who created the extradecomposers! They are interesting creatures! So it is such <span class="from_vocabulary">eagerness</span>! Beatrix has already send a letter to Woman-devil. In this letter she asked her such some questions which <span class="from_vocabulary"> imply</span> the information which can help successfully to plan our meeting.

        It is a clever thought, really. In fact, it is not so surprising that Judy is not afraid. You will be a great <span class="from_vocabulary">connoiseur</span> possessing knowledges in the  extra-decomposers area, won't you?

        A little time later Judy and Beatrix met each-other and talked about the trip to Woman-devil. Beatrix told Judy about such aspects as date, time and place of meeting. There were a few dates when the host would be not at home. Beatrix said that Judy that she could go in any of them.

    <strong data-person="Beatrix">

    <p>
        According to the Woman-devil's words precense of extraneous people can <span class="from_vocabulary">summon</span> host's <span class="from_vocabulary">backlash</span>.

    <p>
        You know, you do not know, of course, the host is not absolutely adequate. But do not worry, please. Also you do not know how strong is Woman-devil. She will defense you from any psycho. But what should  we talk about it if he will not be at home when we go.

    <strong data-person="Judy">

    <p>
        No, of course, it is not. I told that it is not so dirty in this lake. Have you forgotten?

    <strong data-person="Judy">

    <p>
        And other question. Will Woman-devil be unclad in our meeting? I do not want it was so.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">

    <p>

        Judy and Beatrix met Woman-devil near Judy's living place. Woman-devil arrived there on her horse. Of course, it was an <span class="from_vocabulary"> appalling </span> acquaintance for Judy. She saw that Woman-devil looked not very similar to a usual human. She looked like Beatrix described her in  the conversation with Judy and her friends. But Woman-devil was a bit like an ugly scarecrow. Also she was not very similar to a human. She was closer to an attractive toy than to a horrible monster or a human. Her figure was more similar to a figure of a toy than a human figure. Her head was not less wide than shoulders. Her height was lower than Judy's height. It reached Judy's lips. Eyes were very big and their form was more similar to circles than to form of human eyes. Accordingly to it her edge were so big. Hair was in thick and long scythe ending lower her polly. Accordingly to Judy's feelings Woman-devil's hair were very dense like toy's hair. Her polly was visibly wider than the part of her body from shoulders till waist. It seemed <span class="from_vocabulary">daunt</span> to  Judy. She did not like it at the first moment. But Woman-devil smiled friendly and kindly very soon since the first moment when Judy watched at her face. At this moment Judy's perception was changed colossaly. She was surprised how she could perceive Woman-devil's face negatively. Even when her smile had dissapeared from her face Judy was continuing to perceive Woman-devil's face very positively. Woman-devil was closed in a dark swimsuit and dark cloak on her  back. Beatrix presented her and Judy to each-other.

        For you, Lady Devil

    <strong data-person="Beatrix">

    <p>
        I am glad you are getting acquainted. Judy, this is the Woman=devil, the person about whom I told you, Helen and Cassandra. Lady devil, This is Judy. Woman-devil is a great inhabitant on out planet. She has created <span class="from_vocabulary">indispensable remedy </span> to defense this planet from carrion depletion.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">
        Woman-devil
    </strong>
    <p>
        This is a very clever postulation. I can tell you, Judy, more about myself. I really have great magical forces and create my extra-decomposers through them. I gave them such title as extra-decomposers. I gqve Beatrix life. I did not create her, but I remade her. She was very ill and dead. I freed her from illness, turned her into alive, but sleepy human. After that I reduced her, added her respiratory system to breathe water and rolled up in a cocoon, created through my magical forces. Some time later I launched the cocoon. Beatrix woke up with these pretty and bright wigs and horns like wigs and horns of a butterfly. We greeted each-other and told about themselves. After that I allowed her to fly and live everywhere where she wanted. When I and Beatrix had met again she told me about her life in the your friend's aquarium, ocean, swamp and the aquarium of those <span class="from_vocabulary">abhorrent</span> people. Now she has the debt in front of me - to <span class="from_vocabulary">play out</span> a role of an extra-decomposer, because I helped her to aquire life 2 times. I can endue animals consciousness. So I have endued some snakes and swans. Now they understand what I want from them like people. So some swans can serve us as postmen. So I and Beatrix <span class="from_vocabulary">penned</span> when Beatrix lived in the acquarium of your friend. Besides, as you, maybe know, I am here with one serious purpose.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Beatrix">
        Beatrix
    </strong>
    <p>
        And, as I know, you know, what purpose is it. You and all your friends whom I met know as I think. At first turn, Helen with whom I communicated about my mission and place in nature.

    <strong data-person="Judy">

        And our appearance is straight related with Woman-devil. She has created us. So, the mission about which she said is to help nature through us.

        As I know people can not communicate with marine animals besides they can not breathe under water without special water accessories. If Judy can not plunge under water with us lets not to torment ourselves with this disadvantage. We can have a wonderful time out of the ocean.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">

    <p>
        Excuse me, Lady Devil. Did you intend to invite me to be on meeting with you in an ocean except in the lake?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">
        Woman-devil
    </strong>
    <p>
        No, you are not <span class="from_vocabulary">entirely</span> right. There was no invitation to go to lake. There was only my suggestion to visit a part of the ocean. I, Beatrix and many other animals now live in the ocean. We have our <span class="from_vocabulary">confined</span> with a border part in ocean. There a lot  of other different marine animals live in this part with us. We are a big friendly company. Moreover, I was born in the bottom of the ocean. There I have been living during whole my life.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">
        Judy
    </strong>
    <p>
        But Beatrix told that there are swans who swim on the surface of the water space where you live now. She said that it is possible to fly to you using the swans as transport.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">
        Woman-devil
    </strong>
    <p>
        There is a lake not far from our ocean and there are swans. But I did not have such suggestion as to visit water in this lake. I had only such suggestion for you as to visit our part of ocean and see our world. But because you can not to admit this suggestion, I and Beatrix will tell you about our world. It is Pacific ocean and we have to live there near its <span class="from_vocabulary">banks</span> because there are some dishonest people living right there. The nature is <span class="from_vocabulary">contaminated</span> very much. The <span class="from_vocabulary">banks</span> are <span class="from_vocabulary">contaminated</span> too much with different litter and yuck. It is really <span class="from_vocabulary">appallingly</span> and <span class="from_vocabulary">abhorrent</span>! But I see so <span class="from_vocabulary">incentive</span> to work in my wonderful guys extra-decomposers as it must be. I am very glad how they do what they must do.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">

    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">
        Woman-devil

    <p>
        The border is a steal high thick lattice with big cells. It is a very high lattice and was built by me with help of many marine animals. I can negotiate with different marine animals. There are no predators in our <span class="from_vocabulary">confined</span> world. It is very peaceful there. We negotiated to separate the space  and live separately from predatory animals. The space is enough <span class="from_vocabulary">far-flung</span> and it is spaciously for us including Beatrix who does not like little close space. The lattice is only about 1 meter not enough to the surface of the ocean.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Judy">

    <p>
        May I interest what marine animals helped you in building this lattice?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">
        Woman-devil

    <p>
        Merpeople, different extra-decomposers and some marine animals like crabs, tortoises, squids and other. Now anybody who is a predatory animal lives out of our place.

I remember you said the part of ocean where  you live is fenced by a big and thick lattice, but who knows what else? You said you like seeking adventures out  of these your living part of ocean.

        Lady Devil, have you ever had wigs and flew through them?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Woman-devil">

    <p>
        Yes, I had. I can do with myself what I have done with Beatrix but not reducing myself. If I want fly like a butterfly I roll myself in a cocoon and sleep in it. The cocoon hangs on a branch of a very big and strong wood. When I wake up I unwrap the cocoon and have big wigs and horns like a butterfly. I can fly moving my wigs so much as I want. Also I can discard them

        I will tell you about me and our life on the way. But I must warn you that you, may be  will understand not everything clearly. But do not be distressed if it is so. Now I am answering your last  question. You asked how my magic forces are related with strength of the fencing. So I am explaining  you, but at first I must say that it may be very puzzling for you. You as a human may not understand  much. I hope you will be satisfied by the information which you will get from me. Well, what is related  with my forces and this lattce - both are related in reality. Forces like mine let make buildings very  buxom. They can influence phisical laws and as a result my buildings under my own intention. I am an embodiment from the hereafter. So I can do very much. There is no <span class="from_vocabulary">disparity</span> from my  view-point. You were right when you talked about my <span class="from_vocabulary">omnipotence</span>,  because I am not a simple human. I am a devil in human female imagery from the hereafter. I have a  very grander mission in this world and it is for favor for your universe with life planet.

        Do not worry. It is <span class="from_vocabulary">completely</span> not your problem. Only  I and, of course, my creatures which are called, as you see, extra-decomposers are responsible for this.

        People who live near the ocean in which I and Beatrix live now, do not have clear conscience  and do not <span class="from_vocabulary">strive</span> to <span class="from_vocabulary">endorse</span> cleaness.  So nature in the ocean and on its <span class="from_vocabulary">banks</span> is <span class="from_vocabulary"> contaminated</span> very seriously.

        There are 2 ways, but at the moment there is only one way - on my horse. He begins have wigs like bird wigs after distillation. It can <span class="from_vocabulary">raise</span> and fly with them.

        Sometimes I have wigs, too, as I told. I have wigs as if I was a gigantic butterfly. But I make my wigs only after my dreaming through the cocoon like a caterpillar. Current minutes are not my minutes for dream. So now I can not have wigs and bring you and Beatrix to the ocean on my back.

        He was a scientist and one night in his life when he <span class="from_vocabulary">carried out</span> his scientific deal in a forest he collided with a mystery creature.

        It was similar to a monster. But I can not describe it <span class="from_vocabulary">particularly</span>. Sorry. I remember only such facts that it had red burning in darkness eyes and clutches. Christian was <span class="from_vocabulary">daunted</span> with it. So he has <span class="from_vocabulary">abdicated</span> from his engagement and run away from the forest. After that he had <span class="from_vocabulary">tangible</span> troubles in his life.

        I understand. I really can take monsters imaginaries at night when I go to forests and dissipate my extra-decomposers there. I did it. But I do not know how looks Christian and I do not remember how looked the people whom I saw in the forests. So I can not remember my meeting with Christian. But you have to transfer Christian from me the information that he may not to worry in the forests. If I being in a monster imaginary see people in a forest I will take not scary imaginary. And if I see that they are <span class="from_vocabulary"> daunted</span> I will calm down them. I will try not to allow them go mad.
