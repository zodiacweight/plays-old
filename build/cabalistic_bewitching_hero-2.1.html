        There are not one city in the world which has its superhero. Also it is the fact that not every city in the world has a superhero, but there are rumors that the Los Angeles city does. People in this city are very glad about this hypothesis, but it is only a hypothesis. Some people don't beleive in existance of any superhero not only in Los Angeles, but also in the whole world. At the same time not anybody of them thinks about people of the faithful category as about crazy and wacky people. At least it is <span class="from_vocabulary">pertinent</span> to beleive in superheroes in Los Angeles, but not everybody beleives in them.,Sometimes happened some very interesting situations in Los Angeles: people saw somebody like a superhero who helped them in hard situations. After that this information was reported in news, but other people, who might hear and watch via television these news, but did not see no one superhero in their real life. could beleive or not beleive that anything in the news could be a <span class="from_vocabulary">sheer</span>  true. How they can know? Maybe the tv-program was made for public to get financial success thought television, but the news were not true.,This is a storie about one optimistic human who met with the great superhero. Ramon was invited in a arrangement by his friends. They assigned a certain day, time and place for this meeting. At the assigned day Ramon played cards with one of his friends. Later his friends left him and went home to do his <span class="from_vocabulary">undertakings</span>. Ramon was watching news and concert at the tv until the time when his alarm sounded. When the time had come Ramon switched off the tv, dressed, comped, left his living place, sat in his car and set off to event with his new friends.

        Ramon and 2 passed further. They passed the corridor and entered in the first room. Anything what Ramon saw he liked. At least, Ramon and 2 entered in the room where the company wanted to spend time with Ramon.

        It is so great to see you at this moment! We waited impatiently your incoming!
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yeah, exactly. We tired of waiting you! Please, dear, sit down in one of these <span class="from_vocabulary">lounges</span>  and tell us about your bright life, please!
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        Thank you very much.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Carl
    </strong>
    <p>
        Excuse me, but as I remember we wanted to show Ramon the place, but we have not told him about this <span class="from_vocabulary">lounge</span>  yet.

        Have you led Ramon across this place with description places until this space?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Carl

    <p>
        Yes, I have. He likes everything what he saw.

        Great. Lets beging describing this place.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Traves
    </strong>
    <p>
        Lets begin. I don't think there is very much what to tell about all this ambiance. I mean I doubt Ramon is very interested in many of these things, but I can say that one of the gratest wonders is this and this is what must interest Ramon enough. It looks like an <span class="from_vocabulary">abyss</span>, but filled with water. It looks very pretty and <span class="from_vocabulary"> apealing</span>. It is not very inexpensive.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yeah. I see.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Traves
    </strong>
    <p>
        I hope you don't <span class="from_vocabulary">despice boasting</span>.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        I don't, of course.

    </strong>
    <p>
        Now can you sit, please, and tell us about yourself as much as it is possible?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        Indeed.
    </p>
    <strong>
        3
    </strong>
    <p>
        At first, I listened you like <span class="from_vocabulary">gambling</span> and board games.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yeah. It is true. Do you?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Carl
    </strong>
    <p>
        Frankly, we don't like <span class="from_vocabulary">gambling</span> very much.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        Everybody of you?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yes. We don't like to risk money. Why you do?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        It is quite interesting, fascinating and <span class="from_vocabulary">breathtaking</span>. Life would be unbearable boring without something so fascinating and  <span class="from_vocabulary">breathtaking</span> as <span class="from_vocabulary">gambling</span>.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        Don't you afraid to catch very serious problems being not so successfull as you would like?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        I know I and Molly have enough money to <span class="from_vocabulary">afford</span> me to <span class="from_vocabulary">fond</span> such games.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Carl
    </strong>
    <p>
        Seems to me, Molly is very rich and successfull, but you take her money for risk, not she.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        But seems to me these questions are not enough <span class="from_vocabulary">pertinent</span> from you to me.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Carl
    </strong>
    <p>
        I don't think they are unaceptable. We are acquainted with Molly pretty much. We are going to have friendship with you, too. So we pretend to be enough close for you to be <span class="from_vocabulary">entitled</span> to get different information from you which may be related even to your and Molly's financial status.
    </p>
    <strong>
        3
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yeah, dear friend. Don't be so <span class="from_vocabulary">covert</span> and <span class="from_vocabulary">unspoken</span>. We would not like you for that.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        What do you want from me!? Why are you interested in the questions related to our financial status!?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        Why are you so nervious? It is completely <span class="from_vocabulary">opportune</span> for close friends. So we would like to know how much does your Molly earn and how much you can <span class="from_vocabulary">afford</span>  to throw out on your <span class="from_vocabulary">gambling</span>?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        Wha-a-at?
    </p>
    <strong>
        3
    </strong>
    <p>
        Ramon, don't pretend that you didn't hear us.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        I don't think we are already enough close for this discussion. I don't have <span class="from_vocabulary">aptitudes</span> to ask questions like these to the people with whom I am <span class="from_vocabulary">scarcely</span> acquainted.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        All right. Lets change the topic because of your prejudices. I suggest another topic. It is about your age and beauty. How old are you, guy?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        What are you asking me about that for?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        Frankly, you look not very pretty. This your calvity on your head, this big hole among your hair is the reason why you are looking, I can confess, horribly!
    </p>
    <strong>
        Traves
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yes, Ramon, exactly. Martin is right. I have always felt <span class="from_vocabulary">flutter</span> and I am continuing feeling it by the thought regarding to men. Is it really inherented by nature that men begin loosing their hair from his heads with age?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        2, you know, I would give you such advice as to care about your own view most of all instead of caring about my view too much.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Traves
    </strong>
    <p>
        Ramon, don't you want to understand me? Are you not concerned in your own view? I am conderned. My opinion must be important for you. Have you ever thought about how to improve your appearance? I would advise you to try to use a glue and find some artificial hair with a colour like the colour of your natural remained hair, spread glue on your <span class="from_vocabulary">bald</span> and stick artificial hair with their ends on your <span class="from_vocabulary">bald</span> so as not to remain free spaces on this place. So you will look pretty better, trust me.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Carl
    </strong>
    <p>
        Yeah, she is right. Any man has to do as Martin has advised you to look better, any man who has ugliness like yours.
    </p>

        Ramon was at a loss. He was <span class="from_vocabulary">astouned</span> very negatively to hear such abusing and crazy idea. His mood was noticeable on his face. Ramon was staying freezing and with the face full of misunderstanding.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Carl
    </strong>
    <p>
        Why are you looking at us with so strange face expression? Have you ever seen your reflection in a mirror?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        I completely did not expect to hear so absurd thing from any of you! It is rubbish! I am not an alive doll!
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        You can act according to your own opinion, but if you always follow it you will not be successful in some cases. In this case you will be looked at as a scarecrow with a big probability. So I would not act in your way.
    </p>

        Ramon looked at his friends at a loss.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Traves
    </strong>
    <p>
        There is nothing so <span class="from_vocabulary">percussive</span> as you perceive it. I want you to understand us. That's all.
    </p>
    <strong>

    </strong>
    <p>
        I am not sure he will understand us. Seems to me he just cannot to insight into our idea.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        If he is not able to take care of his view it is his problem, not ours.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        Will you have understood at least that I am not a speaking puppet! I am an alive human and it means I don't have to stick hair on my head! Seems to me you are irresponsible or you pretend that you are irresponsible!
    </p>
    <strong>
        Carl
    </strong>
    <p>
        Please, keep calm, dear friend. We are not holding a barrel of weapon near your head to <span class="from_vocabulary">prompt</span> you to act as we would like. It is just an advice and nothing more. Keep calm, please.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        But I'll repeat: it is Ramon's problem, not our problem. Now I think we can change the topic and try not to irritate our dear ghost with our new conversation.
    </p>
    <strong>

    </strong>
    <p>
        Martin smiled with these words.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Carl
    </strong>
    <p>
        Can you suggest us a topic which is desirable for you right now?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        You wanted me to tell about myself, but you began asking me questions which I don't like. There are some topics which are enough <span class="from_vocabulary">pertinent</span> according to my opinion. They are about what I <span class="from_vocabulary">fond</span>, but I will talk to you about it only if you promise me not to ask me stupid questions regarding to the money which are not yours.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        Of course, we promise. What don't you embarass to tell us?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        I can tell about my hobbies.
    </p>
    <strong>
        3
    </strong>
    <p>
        We have already listened about your hobbies, my dear friend. We know you <span class="from_vocabulary">fond</span> playing chess, cards and different sport games related with balls, such as bowling, tennis, football, etc. Molly told us about it. We have representation about these games, too. I doubt you have very much to tell us about these your hobbies. Sorry, my dear friend.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        May be I can tell you about my friends with whom I share these hobbies? Did Molly tell you about them?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        No, she didn't.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        So I can tell you about them.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Traves
    </strong>
    <p>
        One moment, dear friend. It is turning out you already have friends to spend your pleasant time together with them? How is it possible!?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        You would like me not to have friends until this moment? I am <span class="from_vocabulary">entitled</span> to have them. I have ever had the right to have friends and share my interests with them. But I have never gotten the <span class="from_vocabulary">caveat</span> that sometimes I would be gotten acquainted with you and you would <span class="from_vocabulary">take offense</span> at me for my having other friends besides you. So I am not guilty that you have to take pity.
    </p>
    <strong>
        3
    </strong>
    <p>
        Clever idea, by the way!
    </p>
    <strong>
        Carl
    </strong>
    <p>
        Exactly. How many friends do you have?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        I have 5 nice friends. I like when we are going the whole our company all 6 ones of us. But, unfortunately, it happens not everyday.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Carl
    </strong>
    <p>
        I hope it will not be <span class="from_vocabulary">redundant</span> if you will have company of 9 friends.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Martin
    </strong>
    <p>
        You said there are some days when you can play not with all of your 5 friends. So, may be it will be <span class="from_vocabulary">relevant</span> time for us instead of those your friends to join you?
    </p>
    <strong>
        Ramon
    </strong>
    <p>
        May be.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Traves
    </strong>
    <p>
        At least, I have to say something not about our meetings to play games. I have something to add about your view, Ramon. You must stick the hair with their ends on your head so that they sticked up on your head and looked liked those your hair which is natural and presents on your head now. There may be mistake if you stick your hair so that they will lay fully sticked on your head. It will not look nice, trust me, Ramon. Besides, the artificial hair must be the same color that your natural hair which is on your head now.

        Ramon clenched his hands into fists and began <span class="from_vocabulary">creeping</span> towards 2. 2 was staying in one place. All the other men were looking at this moving picture with Ramon and 2. The trajectory at which Ramon was <span class="from_vocabulary">creeping </span> was past the pool. When Ramon had appeared enough close to 2, he <span class="from_vocabulary">swayed</span> his fist at him. 2 take his head from his fist and Ramon missed to hit 2's face. Ramon was going to try to hit 2 once more, but unexpectably 3 made a few steps towards to Ramon and hit him with his leg. Ramon fell in the pool. 2, Martin and Babe came up to 3 closer to the aquarium. All these people looked in it and were seeing Ramon sinking in the water.

        These maniacs were looking in the pool not very long. Soon 3 took a tv-box from the table as he planned and was about to threw it in water. He get closer to the water and then unexpectable the water had been constrained into ice very quickly. 3 had not caught to threw the tv-box in it. All the people were <span class="from_vocabulary">staggered</span> to see this. They were staying freezing and keeping silence for some time. They felt that air was getting colder. One moment Martin turned and run away.

        All the people were staying also. One moment 3 threw the tv-box onto the ice. At the moment when the tv-box reached the place there had been made a big iron sheet on the ice under the tv-box. Soon Martin appeared with a big shovel. He came to the ice and began thrash it with all his <span class="from_vocabulary">vigors</span>. Martin had made a few hits and one of pieces of the ice <span class="from_vocabulary">raised</span> highly and quickly and crashed in his nose very <span class="from_vocabulary">sharply</span>. Martin cried from the pain, fell in the land and the shovel fell near him. 2, 3 and Babe were horrified to see it. Martin touched his flawed place on his face. But soon 3 began speaking.

        Martin did not answer. 3 appeared with a burning branch. He came to the ice and put the branch on it. The ice began smelting. At this moment a <span class="from_vocabulary">fracture</span> began appearing on the ice. In a few moments a piece of the ice was shared off from the ice and <span class="from_vocabulary">soared</span> over the surface of the pool. 3 <span class="from_vocabulary">scarcely</span> had switched his looking and looked at ice as a tv-box flew right at his face from the <span class="from_vocabulary">soaring</span> piece of ice. 3 fell and right at this moment a big tabulate piece of iron <span class="from_vocabulary">soared</span> off the same piece of the ice. It in Babe and 2 and flew off from them. Martin lifted leaning on his palm. He clutched his face with his hands seeing the large piece of the ice hanging in the air. At the first onset this piece of the ice had been splited very quickly and a splinter of this piece of ice hit 1's face very <span class="from_vocabulary">sharply</span> with big force. So Martin fell again.
