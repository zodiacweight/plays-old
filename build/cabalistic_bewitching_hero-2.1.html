        There are not one city in the world which has its superhero. Also it is the fact that not every city in the world has a superhero, but there are rumors that the Los Angeles city does. People in this city are very glad about this hypothesis, but it is only a hypothesis. Some people don't beleive in existance of any superhero not only in Los Angeles, but also in the whole world. At the same time not anybody of them thinks about people of the faithful category as about crazy and wacky people. At least it is <span class="from_vocabulary">pertinent</span> to beleive in superheroes in Los Angeles, but not everybody beleives in them.,Sometimes happened some very interesting situations in Los Angeles: people saw somebody like a superhero who helped them in hard situations. After that this information was reported in news, but other people, who might hear and watch via television these news, but did not see no one superhero in their real life. could beleive or not beleive that anything in the news could be a <span class="from_vocabulary">sheer</span>  true. How they can know? Maybe the tv-program was made for public to get financial success thought television, but the news were not true.,This is a storie about one optimistic human who met with the great superhero. Ramon was invited in a arrangement by his friends. They assigned a certain day, time and place for this meeting. At the assigned day Ramon played cards with one of his friends. Later his friends left him and went home to do his <span class="from_vocabulary">undertakings</span>. Ramon was watching news and concert at the tv until the time when his alarm sounded. When the time had come Ramon switched off the tv, dressed, comped, left his living place, sat in his car and set off to event with his new friends.

I mean I doubt Ramon is very interested in many of these things, but I can say that one of the gratest wonders is this and this is what must interest Ramon enough. It looks like an <span class="from_vocabulary">abyss</span>, but filled with water. It looks very pretty and <span class="from_vocabulary"> apealing</span>. It is not very inexpensive.

    <strong data-person="Martin">

        All right. Lets change the topic because of your prejudices. I suggest another topic. It is about your age and beauty. How old are you, guy?

        Yes, Ramon, exactly. Martin is right. I have always felt <span class="from_vocabulary">flutter</span> and I am continuing feeling it by the thought regarding to men. Is it really inherented by nature that men begin loosing their hair from his heads with age?
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Ramon">

    <p>
        Ramon, don't you want to understand me? Are you not concerned in your own view? I am conderned. My opinion must be important for you. Have you ever thought about how to improve your appearance? I would advise you to try to use a glue and find some artificial hair with a colour like the colour of your natural remained hair, spread glue on your <span class="from_vocabulary">bald</span> and stick artificial hair with their ends on your <span class="from_vocabulary">bald</span> so as not to remain free spaces on this place. So you will look pretty better, trust me.
    </p>
    <strong data-person="Carl">

        You can act according to your own opinion, but if you always follow it you will not be successful in some cases. In this case you will be looked at as a scarecrow with a big probability. So I would not act in your way.

        You would like me not to have friends until this moment? I am <span class="from_vocabulary">entitled</span> to have them. I have ever had the right to have friends and share my interests with them. But I have never gotten the <span class="from_vocabulary">caveat</span> that sometimes I would be gotten acquainted with you and you would <span class="from_vocabulary">take offense</span> at me for my having other friends besides you. So I am not guilty that you have to take pity.

        I have 5 nice friends. I like when we are going the whole our company all 6 ones of us. But, unfortunately, it happens not everyday.

        You said there are some days when you can play not with all of your 5 friends. So, may be it will be <span class="from_vocabulary">relevant</span> time for us instead of those your friends to join you?

        At least, I have to say something not about our meetings to play games. I have something to add about your view, Ramon. You must stick the hair with their ends on your head so that they sticked up on your head and looked liked those your hair which is natural and presents on your head now. There may be mistake if you stick your hair so that they will lay fully sticked on your head. It will not look nice, trust me, Ramon. Besides, the artificial hair must be the same color that your natural hair which is on your head now.

        While Traves was speaking this Ramon was staying freezing and looking at him. When Traves had finished his thought there was a hate flash in Ramon's feelings.

        Ramon clenched his hands into fists and began <span class="from_vocabulary">creeping</span> towards 2. 2 was staying in one place. All the other men were looking at this moving picture with Ramon and 2. The trajectory at which Ramon was <span class="from_vocabulary">creeping </span> was past the pool. When Ramon had appeared enough close to 2, he <span class="from_vocabulary">swayed</span> his fist at him. 2 take his head from his fist and Ramon missed to hit 2's face. Ramon was going to try to hit 2 once more, but unexpectably 3 made a few steps towards to Ramon and hit him with his leg. Ramon fell in the pool. 2, Martin and Babe came up to 3 closer to the aquarium. All these people looked in it and were seeing Ramon sinking in the water.

        These maniacs were looking in the pool not very long. Soon 3 took a tv-box from the table as he planned and was about to threw it in water. He get closer to the water and then unexpectable the water had been constrained into ice very quickly. 3 had not caught to threw the tv-box in it. All the people were <span class="from_vocabulary">staggered</span> to see this. They were staying freezing and keeping silence for some time. They felt that air was getting colder. One moment Martin turned and run away.

        All the people were staying also. One moment 3 threw the tv-box onto the ice. At the moment when the tv-box reached the place there had been made a big iron sheet on the ice under the tv-box. Soon Martin appeared with a big shovel. He came to the ice and began thrash it with all his <span class="from_vocabulary">vigors</span>. Martin had made a few hits and one of pieces of the ice <span class="from_vocabulary">raised</span> highly and quickly and crashed in his nose very <span class="from_vocabulary">sharply</span>. Martin cried from the pain, fell in the land and the shovel fell near him. 2, 3 and Babe were horrified to see it. Martin touched his flawed place on his face. But soon 3 began speaking.

        Martin did not answer. 3 appeared with a burning branch. He came to the ice and put the branch on it. The ice began smelting. At this moment a <span class="from_vocabulary">fracture</span> began appearing on the ice. In a few moments a piece of the ice was shared off from the ice and <span class="from_vocabulary">soared</span> over the surface of the pool. 3 <span class="from_vocabulary">scarcely</span> had switched his looking and looked at ice as a tv-box flew right at his face from the <span class="from_vocabulary">soaring</span> piece of ice. 3 fell and right at this moment a big tabulate piece of iron <span class="from_vocabulary">soared</span> off the same piece of the ice. It in Babe and 2 and flew off from them. Martin lifted leaning on his palm. He clutched his face with his hands seeing the large piece of the ice hanging in the air. At the first onset this piece of the ice had been splited very quickly and a splinter of this piece of ice hit 1's face very <span class="from_vocabulary">sharply</span> with big force. So Martin fell again.
