She was studying in college, <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">thoroughly</span> processing information from her lectures, and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\"> attended</span> all classes. This way Barbara acquired a very good reputation in this college. As you understand, you cannot combine college studies with <span class=\"from_vocabulary\"> nurturing</span> a child. However, whatever strange it was, she still retented the idea to make abortion and to continue her study. For three years she cared for her baby.

This child <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">turned out</span> to be an adult. Perhaps you don’t know what it means. I will explain this to you now. This boy has gradually learned to talk, according to his parents and this was so indeed. At the age of 3 he still did not talk clearly. When he started talking, everyone has been shocked. His speech apparatus hasn’t been trained, but he knew how to talk, he knew all necessary words, he could make sentences, and express his thoughts just like an adult. And then he told his relatives who he really was , told him about his past life and about his goals in this life. They have been amazed! (excited!). They have never experienced anything like this before. It looks like the life of this boy - is not a new life but a continuation of the previous one."]},

So, he started his life not from a scratch,  as everybody, and this even has <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">grander</span> common <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">implications</span>. He came here in order to complete something, that he hasn’t completed in his past life."]},

He had some unfavourable circumstances, which served as <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hurdles</span> him from obtaining his goals. He hasn’t been successful in his past life because his work was too heavy, unbearable for his mind. In this life he is sure that nothing will be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hurdles</span> to his <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">devise</span> and achieving his goals. Christian's relatives were in <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">obscurity</span>, but later they got accustomed."]},

           {"Helen": ["Yes."]},
           {"Judy": ["Yes, but still, how could Barbara <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">afford</span> herself to become pregnant?"]},
           {"Helen": ["I cannot explain this. But I can say that the birth of such a man is amazing, it is a great joy and enormous sensation! Whatever strange this is for his family members, they were <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">compelled</span>to accept it. They caught to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">enlist</span> him to a kindergarden group before they got to know what kind of child he was. Of course, as soon as they realized this, they had to unsubscribe Christian from kindergarten and let him lead an adult life. To add, I can say that for his parents it provides an advantage for their personal comfort. Christian leads an independent adult life and does his work. There were factors which <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">amplified</span>adults. Thus, Barbara has no more any <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">commitments</span> of wife and mother, because her relation with Christian's father has lost any sense and they are separated. Therefore it is easier for her to continue her study at the college. Additional burden for Barbara has already vanished and it vanished much earlier than she expected. To add, such a joy and such pleasant surprise came into her life. She worried about the life which as she thought faced her: to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">tinker</span> with little child everytime, <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">nurtur</span> with him and be tormented. Of course, it was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">overhelming</span> to realize what an unusual child was her son, but from other side, it <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">mollified</span>, because  it <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">turned out</span> Barbara was not right about additional difficulties regarding the little child in her life."]},
           {"Judy": ["Wonderfull. Christian does not worry that his parents are divorced?"]},
           {"Helen": ["No, not at all. He completely understands this divorce, as well as the relation between his parents and he is completely adult and morally wise man. From his perspective it is not adult to worry that his parents have split when their relations have lost any meaning."]},
           {"Cassandra": ["..."]},
           {"Judy": ["And what will he <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">devise</span> in this new life of him?"]},
           {"Helen": ["This we will still find out. This is quite curious and attractive. We can find out about his research in this life. He does it with the same success as he <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">glided</span>. I am sure that his scientific research will still impress us."]},
           {"Judy": ["Yes, but Cassandra shall carefully find this out. By the way, I am curious about the following question. Do you think that his worldview, his knowledge and perception in science are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">nuff</span>? I think there is still something else necessary to do scientific research. One still has to finish school and graduate from university."]},
           {"Helen": ["He already did it in this past life."]},
           {"Judy": ["I already understood. But where is a proof that all his knowledge is from the past live? Who will allow him to do scientific research, without this?"]},
           {"Helen": ["There is no need for paper documents. The truth that he can <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">afford</span> himself to work is already proved. Everybody who has heard him talking about science, cannot take  Christian for an ordinary child. He claims that he is an adult, and a true scientist, who merely looks like a child, and he claims this in a such way that you cannot but trust him. Well, you listen to this and you see how the general axiom on the impossibility of such events is being  slowly denied. When people listen to him, they understand that they are <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">propelled</span> to his words. As a result, nobody can prohibit Christian to live as an adult professor. In this way, Christian in this life has entered science in an unofficial way, without any documents. He managed to enter science, while having at his disposal merely what he had."]}

Beatrix can crawl from the aquarium not awaring the danger for her existence in such a moment when you are not near her. She would like to walk, fly and hunt insects.

Of course, it must be something that contains holes in itself but not big enough so that the inhabitants of the aquarium couldn’t get out. But on other hand Beatrix needs to hunt insects and she will have to get out from the aquarium and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">soar</span> over the vegetable garden to do this.

You got the argument to admit that your dog does not understand or at least does not always understand human statements regarding what is allowed to him and what is not.

I read about not to say <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immense plethora</span> of games but I am very interested of them and I think you will like it, too. I can tell you about some of those games in particular. Many of them have similarities. It is that they are based on quick movement in the water. The principle is following. We <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">plunge</span> into water and sit on the backs of dolphins and merpeople and wear to them with <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">cohesive</span> chains. There will be some bright objects quickly moving in different directions in the water discarded by a game leader. We <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">purport</span> to catch the objects earlier than our foes. So our marine inhabitants will serve us as a vehicles. They will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sweep</span> in the water and their purpose is to obtain such <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">vantage point</span> where we can reach out our hand and touch the object. We will have to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">strive</span> reach the object and touch it according to our purpose and put it in the basket. So we <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">purport</span> to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">muster</span> as many objects as we can. There will be some <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hurdles</span> for the movement to be easy in hurry. There will be such <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hurdles</span> as some objects we will must <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sweep</span> past and not offend. The objects will be such as <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">dustbins</span> and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">rattlesnakes</span>, but they will be not natural. They are only called so. They are such objects only from the game <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">vantage point</span>. But the players must not offend no one of them and if somebody bumps in some of these object he or she will exit from the game. Every caught object gives one or two points to the player catching hold it dependently of size of the object. In this game we all are rivals for each-other. But we can play with (teams) commands and then the commands will play roles of opponents for each-other."

I would like to tell you about a place where I live now. A man <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">wields</span> a house with a court and an <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immense</span> lake. I live in this lake with <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">raft</span> of other marine inhabitants. Recently I have known something here.

He  must come to the lake, be under the surface of it and talk with me. Here he can know what he cannot know somewhere <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">outwards</span> of this hydrosphere. There is very much impressive regardless <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">provenance</span> of extra-decomposers. Besides there is one creature who is responsible for birth of extra-decomposers. If he and Christian meet each-other he can tell Christian very much about that. But he must not know that Christian considers this <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">appointment</span> his scientific <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">scrutiny</span>. In other words Christian can have <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">appointment</span> with this lake inhabitant as just a guest, but not as a scientist. The devil will not approve a meeting if it is a meeting with a scientist who presumes information from communication with the devil's to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">play out</span> important role in his scientific career. The devil will <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">despise</span> such interlocutor and not speak with him. Besides the human who <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">wields</span> all this estate must not know about Christian's visit. It is possible to get into the lake by flying on a big strong swan over the fence and gates. Don’t think that it is <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unfathomable</span> to get to the domain without host's invitation or approval. A swan approvals such visits independently from the host.

I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unwittingly impelled</span> to be sold and so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unwittingly</span> I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">impelled</span> to be bought by one family. A little girl covered the surface of their aquarium with a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">lid</span> with the purpose to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hinder</span> my redemption from her. When she took me from the aquarium I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">impelled</span> to serve the girl as a toy. She played with her toys and me as a living toy. I was a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">striking</span> toy for her. She gave me a name. I said I already had a name, but it did not bother her. Sometimes these games were just <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">untenable</span> for me! Mummy of this girl stitched dresses, blouses, skirts and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">slippers</span> for me. The family saw that I did not like live in their aquarium. They wanted take me with themselves to the beach, but afraid that I would run away from them. I remember one time they caged me into a bird cage and strapped the cage to a ball with a rope. They went to a beach with me <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">confined</span> into these implements. Sometimes it looked like I was an <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">inalienable</span> part of life of these children when they had begun take me with themselves to the beach.

They <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">spurned</span> this idea because they had decided that it would be too inconvenient for them. So they threw me out. Before that I asked the veterinarian if that was possible to me carry about myself without help. The veterinary said that there was necessity to write a long medical prescription.

It was like they <span class=\"from_vocabulary\"></span>professed to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\"></span>affront me and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\"></span>foster resentment in my mood. They asked me questions about Molly's wealth. I perceived these questions not as <span class=\"from_vocabulary\"></span>pertinent questions. So now I suspect they <span class=\"from_vocabulary\"></span>pretended to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\"></span>plunder us and that's why they intended to kill me. So I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">incensed</span>. The <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">sequel</span> was not very happy. There appeared a fight between us. In <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">outcome</span> I fell in those <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">immense</span> acquarium where I could awash if there were not you. I was pushed there by one of these assholes. So they wanted to kill me. The main thought is that they <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">incited</span> me to be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">incensed</span>, because they needed some motive to push me in water.

So I think I may repeat the answer to your question which was what you will must ask Molly about. You must ask why she has decided to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">impose</span> you exactly these people and if she knows that they are murderers or not. I will look at her reaction and gestures when you ask her these questions and she answers them."]},
