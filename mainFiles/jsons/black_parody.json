Usually parodies are funnier and tranquiler than originals, but in this time it is on the contrary: this parody is more nightmarish than original \"Big Lebovsky\". Storie of one of the characters whose name is Quentin was like life of Jeff Lebovsky, but Quentin compared with Jeff Lebovsky is much swifter and much more agressive than this frivolous and unserious \"soplyavka\" Jeff and it was completely not a goodluck decision to go to his living territory not as diserable guests and especially climb to him. He is a strong, surdy and literally iron fight man. Besides thia he is very merciless, ardent, agressive, cruel maniac. So, when people interfered in his life and impeded to his quite life these were the last days in their life. Also there are some characters like characters in \"Big Lebovsky\". Mainly these were a company of idiots who ran Quentin, a dirty tart and one man related to her dirty job. All these people were literally torn when they had met this terrifying person. A murder is something completely normal for Quentin.",

      "<b>Sophie</b> is a dirty tart who cares only about financial wealth. She is a very dirty and shameless harlot. In reality she has a debt in front of one human. This debt is not related to Quentin.",
