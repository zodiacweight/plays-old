    | Now Nick Stevenson is sitting in his invalid armchair and listening the radio. He has been sitting so for
    | a long time, but suddenly he listened that Sophie has come. Sophie entered in the room.

p Oh, where you were so long?
strong(data-person='Sophie') Sophie
p
    | I was in my job, of course. Do you think I did not tell you where I was going to go?

strong(data-person='Nick') Nick
p
    | I am 
    span.from_vocabulary anxious
    |    about something. It is about your debt in front of the

strong(data-person='Sophie') Sophie
p
    | The situation is not so serious as you think, dear. You may calm down and listen to me if you like to be
    | in calm mental mood more than in the mood almost histerical. My producer is not so clever as you presume.
    | He is not clever to such extent to 
    span.from_vocabulary cope with
    |    a situation successfully
    |                                         when somebody has a debt in front of him.

    | How!? What does it mean he is not very clever!? He is so rich and successfull man that my thoughts about
    | his life make me to be tormented by my

    |    to him! It is scary
    |                                         to imagine how much money he gets after every his movie.

p
    | Don't you understand that Vincent is so rich just because many people like such idiotic movies like those
    | ones which he produces. There are some people who is crazy about pornographic movies like the movies
    | of Vincent Kidney and it is not extremely rare case. His movies are very popular and so he is enough
    | rich. Do you

    | Seems to me you are a 
    span.from_vocabulary completed
    |    idiot. You have told something
    span.from_vocabulary completely ludicrous
    |    and besides abused me! Our current conversation
    |                                         is not related with the fact about Vincent Kidney's financial status. At least you could respect me,
    |                                         the human who is much older than you, the man who has lived a long life! I want you very much to listen
    |                                         me carefully. Moreover I want you to grasp my idea. It is enough important! Now I have to tell not about
    |                                         my

    |                                         of your debt in front of Vincent Kidney! Seems to me you don't understand what exactly doesn't keep me
    |                                         calm. You don't understand that it can be so disadvantaged

    |                                         such as we can meet very bad people in our own living place. There will be people trying to beat Vincent
    |                                         Kidney's money out of us! It won't be funny, I assure you! These people will not joke or play with us!

    | Nick did not catch to finish anything what he intended to say, but Sophie had begun speaking before he would
    | have cought to finish his idea.
strong(data-person='Sophie') Sophie
p
    | You may shut up right now! Now it is my turn to speak! I don't intend to listen you too long! Anyway I understand
    | what you would like to say, but I don't need this infromation from you right now. What you wanted to
    | tell me is not new for me. So I said you to shut up. It will be much more better if you listen me now
    | instead of I would listen you so long. And don't call me a fool or a tart like you like to call me. If
    | you continue doing this rather you will have many troubles than I will or we will have together.

    | Nick thought out to continue speaking out his thought about what will happen in his and Sophie's lifes because

    | .
    |                                         He took the decision that it would be better to find out what was on Sophie's mind regarding Vincent
    |                                         Kidney and why she thought that the situation was not so serious and

    |                                         as Nick thought.
strong(data-person='Nick') Nick
p What good thing can tell me a fool like you?
strong(data-person='Sophie') Sophie
p
    | So now I hope you are ready to listen. I am going to explain what I meant when I said that Vincent Kidney
    | is not so clever as you think. I meant that he would not do everything not to be wrong regarding his
    | debtors who take part in his movies. He is not so clever to get his money correctly, trust me.

    | No, I don't beleive it! Is is too difficult and unbeleiveable! How a dirty and

    |                                         with me!? I remember my previous marriage. I was married with a real worthy of respect woman named Ophelia
    |                                         who had earned good money for what we bought all this estate. She was a nice woman at all. She understood
    |                                         me very well everytime. But one day she died because of one hard illness. I even don't want to repeat
    |                                         to myself what illness it was. I thought we were ones of the happiest people of this planet until it
    |                                         happened. Of course, death of my precious Ophelia was tragic for me. I barely regained consciousness
    |                                         after this terrible event. I decided that loneliness would be too heavy load for me and wanted to marry
    |                                         again. Earlier I liked Sophie, but later I found who she is... Besides I fell that it is heavy to divorse
    |                                         with her because of my great estate.

    | and see your wonderful Ophelia instead of this whore.

    | Sophie was unpleasantly surprised that Nick had cursed her with dirty words. She never expected it from him.
    | She even did not span class="from_vocabulary">contemplate about such idea as the idea that Nick could
    | get the idea that Sophie had gotten married hims only just to use his wealth and be
    span.from_vocabulary incensed
    |    because of this circumstance. After this conversation she
    |                                         began to 
    span.from_vocabulary reflect
    |    her plans to get rid of Nick so as it would cost
    |                                         his life. She does not love and appreciate him. She just uses his money in marriage with him. It is not
    |                                         so matter whether he is alive or not. She was sitting in other room and 
    span.from_vocabulary speculating
    |                                         about her idea very deeply. She was not considered to pay her debt. Her opinion was that it was not necessary.
p
    | After this empty conversation Sophie and Nick almost did not see each-other. Sometimes it happened so that
    | Nick saw how Sophie went past him when she was going somewhere in the house. But Nick and Sophie lived
    | their own life each-other separately.
p One day Sophie whispered so as Nick did not hear:
strong(data-person='Sophie') Sophie
p
    | Don't worry, dear. There only a few days are remaining, every day less and less until the term will be completed
    | and then we will never see each-other again!
