I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unwittingly impelled</span> to be sold and so <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">unwittingly</span> I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">impelled</span> to be bought by one family. A little girl covered the surface of their aquarium with a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">lid</span> with the purpose to <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">hinder</span> my redemption from her. When she took me from the aquarium I was <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">impelled</span> to serve the girl as a toy. She played with her toys and me as a living toy. I was a <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">striking</span> toy for her. She gave me a name. I said I already had a name, but it did not bother her. Sometimes these games were just <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">untenable</span> for me! Mummy of this girl stitched dresses, blouses, skirts and <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">slippers</span> for me. The family saw that I did not like live in their aquarium. They wanted take me with themselves to the beach, but afraid that I would run away from them. I remember one time they caged me into a bird cage and strapped the cage to a ball with a rope. They went to a beach with me <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">confined</span> into these implements. Sometimes it looked like I was an <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">inalienable</span> part of life of these children when they had begun take me with themselves to the beach. I had such dream thought that the children would grew up and toys will be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">repealed</span> and may be my freedom would be <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">resumed</span>. But there had been one coup of events in result of which I had breached to the will earlier than the children would grow up."

I had <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">guessworks</span> regarding my illness, but nobody of the members of the family believed me.

I had lived in nature without help for some time being ill while the woman-devil took me under her <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">oversaw</span>.
