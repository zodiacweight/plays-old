He has never done and could do it before in his life. How did he do it in this time he did not understand. Soon he noticed that there is something like big drifts swimming out from his back and when he had <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">swayed</span> with bottom part of his body he saw something like a tail of a mermaid instead of the bottom half of his body which he had ever had. Ramon was feared. He remembered that he had fallen in the aquarium, but he could understand nothing of what could happen at the time when he had woken up. Soon he had seen somebody like mermaid and with big transparent wigs swimming towards to him from the front side. This mermaid was like a Barbie: long white queue of blonde hair, big roll blue eyes and gentle pink lips. The mermaid has big green <span class=\"from_vocabulary\">transpicuous</span>  wigs like Ramon's ones. She was swimming moving her hands, tail and wigs. So Ramon was terribled more to see himself in water not like he had accustomed to see himself and this strange creature in front of him. He shook. Mermaid swam closer to him. After that she began getting up and Ramon had felt that he was getting up despite nobody and nothing was not touching him. Just Ramon and the mermaid emerged from the water and flew over it the mermaid began speaking not loudly."]},
